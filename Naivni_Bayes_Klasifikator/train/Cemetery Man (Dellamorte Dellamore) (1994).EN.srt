2
00:00:57,913 --> 00:00:59,623
- Hello?
- It's me.

3
00:00:59,623 --> 00:01:02,376
Oh, am I bothering you, Francesco?

4
00:01:02,584 --> 00:01:05,712
No, don't worry, I had to get
out of the shower some time.

5
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:07,464
Hold on a minute, Franco...

6
00:01:28,318 --> 00:01:29,736
You were saying, Franco?

7
00:01:29,987 --> 00:01:33,323
No, no, nothing. Just
calling to see how you doing.

8
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:35,492
You know how things are...

9
00:01:40,163 --> 00:01:41,748
...life goes on.

10
00:02:14,698 --> 00:02:16,116
Gnaghi!

11
00:02:44,394 --> 00:02:47,564
I've been shouting at
you for hours. Gnaghi!

12
00:03:04,373 --> 00:03:06,500
He's Ghigini, the surveyor.

13
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,336
- 12th row, 3rd grave, right?
- Gna.

14
00:03:22,891 --> 00:03:24,142
Grave three.

15
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:27,145
Here we go.

16
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,773
I know you've heard this before,

17
00:03:30,107 --> 00:03:31,233
but this time,

18
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,318
my dear Ghigini,

19
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:35,612
it is forever.

20
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,323
Rest in peace!

21
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:42,578
Oh, my back...

22
00:03:51,962 --> 00:03:53,297
What a waste of good marble.

23
00:03:53,505 --> 00:03:54,840
Never looks right when you fix it.

24
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:56,925
All this fancy packaging.

25
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:59,720
I don' know why they don't
just cover the graves with dirt.

26
00:04:50,062 --> 00:04:52,564
The gun! I forgot the fucking gun!

27
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,984
- Ea...t!
- Gnaghi,

28
00:04:56,527 --> 00:04:58,278
give me the spade! Gnaghi!

29
00:04:58,487 --> 00:05:00,072
give me the fucking spade!

30
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,544
There we go.

31
00:05:16,964 --> 00:05:19,299
You handle the rest Gnaghi.

32
00:05:20,217 --> 00:05:23,136
My name is Francesco Dellamorte.

33
00:05:23,387 --> 00:05:24,680
Weird name, isn't it?

34
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,265
Francis Of Death.

35
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:28,725
Saint Francis Of Death.

36
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:31,144
I often thought of having it changed.

37
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:34,231
Andrea Dellamorte would
be nicer, for example.

38
00:05:34,606 --> 00:05:37,276
I'm the watchman of
the Buffalora cemetery,

39
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,820
I don't know how the epidemic started,

40
00:05:39,987 --> 00:05:43,448
All I know is that some people,
on the 7th night after their death

41
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:45,325
come back to life.

42
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:47,828
I call them "Returners",

43
00:05:48,453 --> 00:05:51,665
but frankly I can't understand
why they're so anxious to return.

44
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,251
The only way to get rid
of them once and for all,

45
00:05:54,459 --> 00:05:56,128
is to split their heads open.

46
00:05:56,336 --> 00:05:59,590
A spade'll do it, but a
Dum-Dum bullet is best.

47
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,758
Come and have a glass of wine.

48
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:08,765
Is this the beginning of an invasion?
Does it happen in all cemeteries,

49
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:11,810
or is Buffalora just an exception?

50
00:06:12,102 --> 00:06:15,606
Who knows? And in the end, who cares?

51
00:06:16,607 --> 00:06:18,483
I'm just doing my job.

52
00:06:26,283 --> 00:06:29,620
Good morning engineer.
How are you doing today?

53
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:31,955
Fine, Miss Chiaromondo. And you?

54
00:06:32,122 --> 00:06:33,916
The cemetery is open, isn't it?

55
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,001
For you, any time.

56
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:40,589
Hello cutie. Here...

57
00:06:41,215 --> 00:06:42,883
How are you?

58
00:06:42,966 --> 00:06:46,345
He's happy. He likes
it when the sun shines.

59
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:54,353
I'm not an engineer...

60
00:06:56,855 --> 00:06:58,941
...and you are no cutie.

61
00:07:07,074 --> 00:07:10,327
Poor Gnaghi, on his ID card it reads:

62
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:13,413
"Distinctive physical marks: all".

63
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,001
He has a real passion for dead leaves,

64
00:07:18,252 --> 00:07:20,963
can't stand it when the
wind blows them away...

65
00:07:22,589 --> 00:07:24,007
Oh well,

66
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:27,469
we all do what we can
not to think about life.

67
00:08:42,377 --> 00:08:45,589
The most beautiful living
woman I have ever seen!

68
00:08:48,217 --> 00:08:50,093
Will I see her again?

69
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,584
I just came to water the flowers
on your poor father's grave.

70
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:26,880
Husband.

71
00:09:31,593 --> 00:09:33,136
How long has he been dead?

72
00:09:35,848 --> 00:09:37,307
Two weeks.

73
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:39,268
- Thank goodness.
- What?

74
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:43,146
- I mean, I'm very sorry.
- Have you no respect for pain?

75
00:09:43,355 --> 00:09:44,815
Well, you know how these
things are... You see:

76
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:48,569
- in time, pain heals.
- It's not healing a bit.

77
00:09:53,574 --> 00:09:55,242
He was wonderful,

78
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:58,787
he was a wonderful lover, incredible,

79
00:09:59,246 --> 00:10:00,747
tireless.

80
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,960
He was fantastic!

81
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:35,532
I messed it all up,

82
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,201
I've lost her.

83
00:10:38,243 --> 00:10:40,329
Will I see her again?

84
00:10:50,297 --> 00:10:51,465
Hey, Franco!

85
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,639
Franco is the only living person

86
00:10:58,764 --> 00:11:01,475
who even calls me. Now and
then I stop by his office

87
00:11:01,683 --> 00:11:03,977
to remind myself what he looks like.

88
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:06,396
You can't live on memories alone.

89
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:14,488
It's for you. Sign as usual.

90
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:20,911
- Have you got a pen?
- No.

91
00:11:21,119 --> 00:11:22,996
Hold on a sec, here we are.

92
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,170
Have you had any visits last nights?

93
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:31,839
A couple, yes.

94
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,761
All this extra work! It's
much if the pay me any more.

95
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:39,555
Tell the Mayor...

96
00:11:39,763 --> 00:11:43,058
Oh, tell the Mayor then what?
They'd close the cemetery.

97
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:45,060
Good-bye job and
good-bye house!

98
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,437
Come on, who do you
think would believe you?

99
00:11:47,521 --> 00:11:49,481
Listen, I don't care if
you don't believe me Franco,

100
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,358
you're not the one who pays me!

101
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,860
I believe you,

102
00:11:53,068 --> 00:11:55,112
I believe you, and you're right...

103
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,072
- At least have him pay the overtime.
- Good.

104
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,657
Well, let's go to the Mayor, then!

105
00:11:59,032 --> 00:12:00,284
It's not that easy.

106
00:12:00,784 --> 00:12:03,203
First you have to fill out an M3 form,

107
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:06,123
report with an M3 form...

108
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:07,791
Forms...

109
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:10,794
I could speed things up there for you...

110
00:12:11,211 --> 00:12:13,130
It's easier just to shoot them.

111
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:17,885
One M3 form!

112
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,637
Going to get our willies wet tonight?

113
00:12:20,804 --> 00:12:22,598
Some of us, yeah.

114
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:27,477
Hell, at a certain point
in life, you realize

115
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:29,980
you know more dead people than living.

116
00:13:41,593 --> 00:13:44,429
Sorry about the other day, I was
a bit crass. I didn't mean to be.

117
00:13:44,638 --> 00:13:46,849
My name's Francesco Dellamorte.

118
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:50,477
You know, this is the
only job I could get

119
00:13:50,602 --> 00:13:53,105
even with a degree in biology.

120
00:13:55,315 --> 00:13:57,901
Anyway we all end up here
sooner or later, don't we?

121
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:01,655
I've got a great little
house... Want to see it?

122
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:05,826
I don't live alone, I've
got a helper, Gnaghi.

123
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:08,120
He's a real conversationist!

124
00:14:10,747 --> 00:14:13,750
The cemetery's small, but
it's got a marvellous ossuary!

125
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:19,173
An ossuary...

126
00:14:33,145 --> 00:14:35,856
I have never seen anything so...

127
00:14:36,064 --> 00:14:37,858
exciting!

128
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,193
Neither have I.

129
00:15:11,934 --> 00:15:13,727
It's like in my dreams!

130
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:15,896
This is my dream.

131
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:20,150
I couldn't ask for anything more.

132
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,109
Me neither.

133
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:30,285
You know, you've got
a real nice ossuary.

134
00:15:30,911 --> 00:15:32,079
Thanks.

135
00:15:33,914 --> 00:15:36,542
You will allow me to return, won't you?

136
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:40,504
You will allow me to kiss
you just once, won't you?

137
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:41,964
No.

138
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:44,049
Not like this.

139
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:52,891
Like this.

140
00:16:21,587 --> 00:16:24,214
I must be faithful to
the memory of my husband!

141
00:16:25,465 --> 00:16:28,719
I can't. I can't!

142
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:32,723
It's not my fault... It's this place.

143
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:37,477
I feel strange tremors.

144
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,062
It's not the cold...

145
00:16:39,271 --> 00:16:40,355
I'm not afraid...

146
00:16:40,772 --> 00:16:44,151
This place wants me to...
It's forcing me to...

147
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:47,237
I don't want to!

148
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:51,200
I don't want to!

149
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,705
I can't! I can't!

150
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:45,207
Don't be afraid, it's just ignis fatuus.

151
00:19:48,544 --> 00:19:49,711
Why here?

152
00:19:50,337 --> 00:19:52,840
Why on your poor husband's grave?

153
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,509
I've never kept anything from him...

154
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:58,178
We trusted each other implicitly.

155
00:19:59,429 --> 00:20:01,181
He would have liked to know.

156
00:20:03,141 --> 00:20:06,019
Well, if that's the case...

157
00:20:15,362 --> 00:20:16,613
All these lights!

158
00:20:16,947 --> 00:20:18,407
Let them watch.

159
00:20:18,699 --> 00:20:21,952
What's better than watching
two lovers making love, hey?

160
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:27,374
Just to have a bit of privacy.

161
00:20:38,302 --> 00:20:41,805
Sorry, but the lady wants stars only.

162
00:22:12,646 --> 00:22:16,400
It's never been like
this before, with anybody.

163
00:22:16,608 --> 00:22:17,943
Only you.

164
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:20,404
No one will ever make us part.

165
00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:27,369
Gnaghi! The gun!

166
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:30,080
I can explain! Listen to me,

167
00:22:31,206 --> 00:22:33,000
you've always been so understanding!

168
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,127
That's life!

169
00:22:56,982 --> 00:22:58,442
It's nothing my love,

170
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,027
you're fine.

171
00:23:02,487 --> 00:23:03,614
Great,

172
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:05,407
just when I don't need it anymore.

173
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:09,286
Well don't just stand there!
Go call doctor Vercesi!

174
00:23:10,537 --> 00:23:12,915
Go on, get the doctor!

175
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,584
Go on! Move!

176
00:23:16,293 --> 00:23:17,961
Nothing can separate us.

177
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:20,422
I swear, nothing.

178
00:23:27,721 --> 00:23:30,891
Nothing will separate us, will it?

179
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,894
Nothing, my love. Nothing.

180
00:23:37,314 --> 00:23:39,983
Not even death?

181
00:23:40,192 --> 00:23:42,069
Not even death.

182
00:24:19,273 --> 00:24:23,360
Dellamorte, are you
in there? Dellamorte!

183
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:38,750
Jesus! You scared me to death!

184
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:40,627
Were you looking for
me, Chief Straniero?

185
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:43,213
Yes, Dr. Vercesi called.
What happened last night?

186
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:45,632
Well you know. Why are
you asking me? She's dead.

187
00:24:45,841 --> 00:24:46,884
I know she's dead,

188
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:48,552
but how did that happen?

189
00:24:49,803 --> 00:24:51,138
Her husband.

190
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:54,183
Sure! He came back from
the dead, he raped her,

191
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:55,851
then bit her to death.
Is that what he did?

192
00:24:56,059 --> 00:24:57,519
No, he didn't rape her.

193
00:24:57,728 --> 00:25:00,147
Oh, you always crack me up, you know!

194
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:02,232
Dr. Vercesi, are you spying on us?

195
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:04,067
No, I dropped this certificate.

196
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:07,237
Her heart stopped from fear, it
wasn't the bite that killed her.

197
00:25:07,404 --> 00:25:11,283
She died while making...
well you know... doing it.

198
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:14,077
You know what that means, my boy?

199
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:16,663
I'll have to look somewhere else
for the creep who killed her!

200
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:19,166
- You are no longer a suspect.
- Why not?

201
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,919
Well, you know what I mean.

202
00:25:22,252 --> 00:25:23,962
Look, don't make me say it!

203
00:25:24,171 --> 00:25:27,090
Go on, you can say it. I
don't mind, I'm impotent!

204
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:30,344
Don't use that word! A young
man like you, at your age...

205
00:25:30,552 --> 00:25:31,303
Did she have any relatives?

206
00:25:31,512 --> 00:25:33,805
No, no relatives, no friends.

207
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:37,976
Well, I have to say that...

208
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:40,145
Shit! This is definitely not my style!

209
00:25:43,941 --> 00:25:46,485
- Can I keep her here?
- If you pay for the funeral, of course

210
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:48,278
you can do whatever
the hell you want with her.

211
00:25:48,612 --> 00:25:50,697
- Does that wrap it up, then?
- Yeah, except for a killer on the loose.

212
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:52,783
Care to join me for a cup of tea?

213
00:25:54,243 --> 00:25:56,703
The weather's changing at last!

214
00:26:16,974 --> 00:26:19,142
I can't forgive myself
for having lied to you:

215
00:26:20,227 --> 00:26:22,604
I don't have a degree in biology,

216
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:25,732
I didn't even finish high school.

217
00:26:29,903 --> 00:26:32,906
I haven't read more than
two books in my whole life:

218
00:26:34,074 --> 00:26:35,951
one,

219
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,662
never finished,

220
00:26:40,831 --> 00:26:43,041
and the other is the phone book.

221
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:05,439
I don't want her to become a Returner.

222
00:27:05,981 --> 00:27:08,066
I don't want to see her again.

223
00:27:34,635 --> 00:27:35,886
No!

224
00:27:36,303 --> 00:27:38,096
Yes, my love!

225
00:27:39,473 --> 00:27:40,766
No, don't make me do it!

226
00:27:40,974 --> 00:27:43,227
But if you do it so well... so well!

227
00:27:45,062 --> 00:27:46,021
Not to you!

228
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,815
It will be better with
me than with the others!

229
00:28:37,322 --> 00:28:38,282
Gna!

230
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,958
You do it!

231
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:53,380
Well go on! If you finish
fast I'll buy you an ice-cream.

232
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:54,548
Gna!

233
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:06,226
- Here comes the Unforgiven.
- Who?

234
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:08,061
The Tombstone Mayor.

235
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:12,482
The man whose dick's so
small he pees with tweezers.

236
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:17,529
He could become a
woman. That'd solve it!

237
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:20,657
They are sewing them
back on in the States now.

238
00:29:21,074 --> 00:29:23,202
Yeah, they can stitch it right on,
if you've got one to start with.

239
00:29:23,494 --> 00:29:25,162
Forget it, I started that rumour.

240
00:29:25,412 --> 00:29:27,247
The more they laugh, the
further away they seem.

241
00:29:27,581 --> 00:29:29,666
You can never be too different, Gnaghi.

242
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:32,794
Maybe you can.

243
00:29:33,003 --> 00:29:34,671
Engineer!

244
00:29:35,881 --> 00:29:39,760
Engineer, engineer, come! Have a seat!

245
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,013
Well well well, what a surprise!

246
00:29:43,305 --> 00:29:46,850
Yes! It's a miracle
seeing you here, engineer!

247
00:29:47,059 --> 00:29:49,645
It's a miracle seeing
you here, Mr. Mayor.

248
00:29:49,978 --> 00:29:54,191
So, how are things down at
our cemetery? How are things?

249
00:29:54,358 --> 00:29:55,943
Well how do you think things are?

250
00:29:56,151 --> 00:29:57,194
Population's shrinking.

251
00:29:57,402 --> 00:30:00,322
You're lucky, my dear engineer!

252
00:30:00,531 --> 00:30:03,784
You just can't imagine how
things are at the Town Hall.

253
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:05,661
Now that the elections are upon us,

254
00:30:05,869 --> 00:30:08,288
it is chaos, right, inspector?

255
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:11,625
Yeah, it's a thrill for all,
nobody wants to lose their job.

256
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,460
I was hoping for a New Deal...

257
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:15,796
Daddy, what's this?

258
00:30:16,004 --> 00:30:18,465
This is my assistant Gnaghi.

259
00:30:24,137 --> 00:30:25,347
He's sweet!

260
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:27,307
Will you buy him, daddy?

261
00:30:28,725 --> 00:30:32,062
That's great, it even knows how to cry!

262
00:30:32,271 --> 00:30:33,897
Gnaghi, don't stay so close to her.

263
00:30:34,106 --> 00:30:35,858
Could you move over, darling?

264
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:37,818
Would you tell your
daughter to move over please?

265
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,902
Yes of course.

266
00:30:39,111 --> 00:30:40,737
Sometimes Gnaghi gets a little bit excited...

267
00:30:40,946 --> 00:30:43,115
Oh, I'm sure he's
charming. Now, where was I?

268
00:30:49,288 --> 00:30:51,665
What's he doing? Dancing?

269
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:54,251
No, no, he's just about to...

270
00:30:58,088 --> 00:30:59,882
What the hell are you doing Valentina?

271
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:02,092
He threw up on me, Claudio!

272
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:03,552
Oh, a new fact!

273
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:05,512
Would you like to go for a ride?

274
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:08,182
I knew you'd understand!

275
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,350
Take off!

276
00:31:15,522 --> 00:31:17,774
By the way, one of these days

277
00:31:17,983 --> 00:31:19,943
I have to talk to you
about the cemetery.

278
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:25,449
The youth of today...
They're so... emotional.

279
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,542
Come on, Gnaghi! Get in, for God's sake!

280
00:31:35,751 --> 00:31:37,878
Don't do this, just get in the car!

281
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:41,048
It's not the end of the world,
It didn't even bother her!

282
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:43,634
She understood it was just a
demonstration of your affection.

283
00:31:43,842 --> 00:31:47,554
Anyway, it's not the first time
you threw up over a woman, is it?

284
00:31:50,432 --> 00:31:52,726
Come on, Gnaghi, get in!

285
00:31:54,728 --> 00:31:57,397
Look, first love doesn't count.

286
00:31:57,606 --> 00:31:59,608
It's last love that counts!

287
00:32:07,783 --> 00:32:10,118
Nobody came today.

288
00:32:10,327 --> 00:32:12,079
I was a bit bored,

289
00:32:12,287 --> 00:32:15,624
not even the admiral...
he's just disappeared!

290
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:18,544
Let's hope tomorrow, okay?

291
00:32:18,752 --> 00:32:21,129
Yeah, come again and stay a while.

292
00:32:21,338 --> 00:32:25,717
Oh, he was such a
distinguished man, the admiral!

293
00:32:25,926 --> 00:32:29,221
Always used to bring me, always,

294
00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:32,432
a touch of Sambuca.

295
00:33:05,465 --> 00:33:07,426
Oh, come on Gnaghi!

296
00:33:08,051 --> 00:33:09,469
You'll get over, you'll see!

297
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:14,391
Time passes,

298
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:16,143
nothing seems the same...

299
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,065
It just gets worse.

300
00:33:22,816 --> 00:33:25,319
God, is it ever difficult
trying to make you feel better!

301
00:33:28,322 --> 00:33:31,492
What were you doing with the Mayor's
daughter anyway? She's only a child!

302
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:33,452
Gna!

303
00:33:35,829 --> 00:33:39,166
Oh yeah, that's not true,
you are not a child, Gnaghi.

304
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:42,669
You're a year older than I am. Anyway...

305
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,339
One day,

306
00:33:45,547 --> 00:33:47,341
you'll settle down with some...

307
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:49,927
poor creature like yourself.

308
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,390
In the meanwhile, why do you care?

309
00:33:55,766 --> 00:33:58,477
They all end up here
sooner or later, Gnaghi.

310
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,438
Often sooner than later.

311
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,442
Faster, open it up!

312
00:34:07,653 --> 00:34:09,947
- If daddy could see us now!
- He'd kill me!

313
00:34:12,533 --> 00:34:13,700
Claudio!

314
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:15,786
- Off we go!
- Go!

315
00:34:20,791 --> 00:34:22,543
Go! Go!

316
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:24,753
Go!

317
00:34:34,137 --> 00:34:36,431
- Hang on!
- Eat our dust!

318
00:34:53,532 --> 00:34:55,075
Four motorcycles racing...

319
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:56,743
The Mayor's daughter is on one of them.

320
00:34:57,077 --> 00:34:58,745
Her head was sliced right off.

321
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:00,497
They had to sew it back on the body.

322
00:35:00,747 --> 00:35:03,750
The bikes crashed into
a bus loaded with scouts

323
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:06,879
on their way back from
a church-sponsored rally.

324
00:35:07,087 --> 00:35:08,839
Slaughter of the innocents!

325
00:35:09,256 --> 00:35:10,841
And they were all so young.

326
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:15,012
They felt their life was ahead of them,
but in fact they were already passing by.

327
00:35:15,429 --> 00:35:17,014
Well, you've got your hands full!

328
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:18,849
Oh, more than you know!

329
00:35:19,391 --> 00:35:21,894
Gnaghi, we're going to
need a lot of bullets.

330
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:30,110
# Never should have gone
out on the Boy Scout picnic,

331
00:35:30,444 --> 00:35:33,780
# never should have, never
should have gone just then.

332
00:35:34,114 --> 00:35:37,201
# Never should have gone
out on the Boy Scout picnic,

333
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:41,205
# Never should have, now
I'll never go again! #

334
00:35:41,413 --> 00:35:43,081
Claudio! Take me with you!

335
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,959
Don't leave me all alone, Claudio!

336
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,961
Take me with you, my love!

337
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:50,380
Nasty tart!

338
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:53,175
My son wasn't with you!

339
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,385
He was promised to the Mayor's daughter!

340
00:35:55,677 --> 00:35:58,055
- But he loved me!
- Liar!

341
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:00,807
He was mine, he loved me!

342
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:04,144
- Only me!
- Have you no respect for a mother's pain?

343
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:06,647
We're born to die,

344
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:09,233
born merely to die.

345
00:36:09,441 --> 00:36:11,068
Do you remember?

346
00:36:11,318 --> 00:36:12,653
Just yesterday,

347
00:36:12,903 --> 00:36:15,280
she was alive, happy.

348
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:17,241
Do you remember?

349
00:36:17,574 --> 00:36:20,160
Dear Gnaghi even threw up on her,

350
00:36:20,494 --> 00:36:22,329
and she took it so well!

351
00:36:22,913 --> 00:36:25,624
And now, she's gone...

352
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:28,627
and right on the eve of the elections!

353
00:36:28,836 --> 00:36:31,129
I better get the pickaxe and shovel.

354
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,217
Pumpkin, how could you do this to me?

355
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,084
Is it true as they say, that the
dead come back to life here at night?

356
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,544
Tell me the truth!

357
00:37:10,752 --> 00:37:11,795
Hey! Who told you that?

358
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:14,965
Is it true or not? Is it true or not?

359
00:37:15,257 --> 00:37:16,466
What if it is?

360
00:37:16,675 --> 00:37:19,219
I've got to see Claudio again!

361
00:37:19,386 --> 00:37:21,722
I have to know whether
he loved me or her!

362
00:37:21,889 --> 00:37:23,807
If I hear anything, I'll let you know.

363
00:37:24,808 --> 00:37:26,476
No, wait...

364
00:37:27,102 --> 00:37:29,313
Go away! I haven't got
time for the living!

365
00:38:09,061 --> 00:38:10,521
Gnaghi?

366
00:38:55,858 --> 00:38:56,900
Gnaghi!

367
00:38:57,526 --> 00:39:00,445
Gnaghi, they came back
sooner than we thought!

368
00:39:01,488 --> 00:39:03,157
Gnaghi wake up!

369
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:24,136
Gnaghi, watch out!

370
00:40:28,242 --> 00:40:29,076
Gnaghi,

371
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,704
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

372
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:44,508
Well, that's it, time's up and

373
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:47,970
I want you upstairs and
ready in five minutes! Okay?

374
00:42:01,168 --> 00:42:02,836
Oh no, what's she doing here?

375
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:17,309
Visiting hours are over!

376
00:42:17,684 --> 00:42:19,770
No one is going to
take me away from him!

377
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:24,858
Quick, get the fuck over here! Quick!

378
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:27,903
No, Claudio!

379
00:43:08,861 --> 00:43:13,365
Claudio, take me with
you! Don't leave me!

380
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:15,951
Stupid cow!

381
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,165
Come on!

382
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,380
Wait! Wait!

383
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:34,928
Claudio please, take me with you!

384
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,973
Tell me you only love me!

385
00:43:39,224 --> 00:43:40,684
Please...

386
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,410
Claudio!

387
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:03,081
You only love me, right?

388
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:32,027
Damn! It always shoots to
the right when it's cold.

389
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:55,634
Gnaghi!

390
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:38,302
No, please don't! He's only eating me!

391
00:45:38,927 --> 00:45:39,761
Move aside.

392
00:45:40,262 --> 00:45:43,432
Mind your business! I shall
be eaten by whoever I please!

393
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,268
This is my business. They pay me for it.

394
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:01,325
The living dead

395
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:04,578
and the dying living are all the same.

396
00:46:04,786 --> 00:46:07,247
Cut from the same cloth.

397
00:46:07,789 --> 00:46:11,043
But disposing of dead
people is a public service,

398
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:13,504
whereas you're in all sorts of trouble

399
00:46:13,712 --> 00:46:16,798
if you kill someone
while they're still alive.

400
00:46:27,392 --> 00:46:28,560
Wait!

401
00:46:46,161 --> 00:46:48,247
This way they'll be together forever.

402
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,214
I'm sentimental.

403
00:47:17,985 --> 00:47:19,653
Patience, Gnaghi.

404
00:47:19,862 --> 00:47:22,239
In love, it's the waiting
that's the best part.

405
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:25,909
You have to learn how to wait.

406
00:48:44,947 --> 00:48:47,533
- What's your name again?
- Gna!

407
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:49,451
Gnaghi.

408
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,500
I'm Valentina.

409
00:48:57,376 --> 00:48:59,628
Haven't I seen you before?

410
00:49:01,296 --> 00:49:04,216
Oh yeah. Now I remember.

411
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:06,718
You threw up on me. How sweet!

412
00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:17,354
But I like shy boys.

413
00:49:17,729 --> 00:49:20,440
And you never say no to a kiss.

414
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,692
Take advantage.

415
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:25,529
I'm certainly in no position
to refuse. Besides,

416
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,531
I don't think I'd refuse anyway.

417
00:50:41,063 --> 00:50:42,523
False alarm!

418
00:50:43,774 --> 00:50:45,526
It was only a cat.

419
00:50:54,201 --> 00:50:56,995
No use you trying
to help me, little thing!

420
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,915
If I can't do it, imagine you...

421
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:03,043
Putting this skull together,

422
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,588
is one of the most difficult
things in the world.

423
00:51:41,623 --> 00:51:43,917
You know, you really are
disgusting when you eat, Gnaghi.

424
00:51:44,334 --> 00:51:45,586
Gna!

425
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,425
Yes, you're right. I suppose it all does
get mixed up in the stomach, in the end.

426
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:56,430
What is it?

427
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:36,887
That wasn't a cat!

428
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:24,578
We can't! I'm alive,

429
00:54:27,414 --> 00:54:28,248
and you are dead.

430
00:54:29,082 --> 00:54:31,668
I'm not prejudiced, my love.

431
00:55:56,879 --> 00:55:58,547
I killed her!

432
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,633
Gna!

433
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:07,848
I killed her!

434
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:17,608
I killed her.

435
00:56:18,442 --> 00:56:22,446
The first time, when her husband
bit her, she wasn't really dead.

436
00:56:22,738 --> 00:56:24,948
When she woke up, and I
shot her, she was alive.

437
00:56:26,366 --> 00:56:27,868
I killed her.

438
00:56:28,702 --> 00:56:31,371
I killed the only woman I ever loved.

439
00:56:31,705 --> 00:56:33,874
I shot her with my eyes closed,

440
00:56:34,124 --> 00:56:35,792
didn't aim for the head.

441
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:37,753
That's why she came back.

442
00:56:38,378 --> 00:56:40,464
God, what an idiot!

443
00:56:41,632 --> 00:56:43,884
Now, I'm infected too.

444
00:56:44,134 --> 00:56:46,637
Will I be a Returner when I die?

445
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:50,057
Who knows if Gnaghi...

446
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,435
No, poor Gnaghi, he'd
never have the guts

447
00:56:53,644 --> 00:56:55,646
to crush my skull with a shovel.

448
00:56:57,773 --> 00:57:01,401
I'm not dead, you idiot!
A bite can't kill you!

449
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:09,493
Good morning, engineer!

450
00:57:10,244 --> 00:57:12,538
Miss Chiaromondo, I'm not an engineer.

451
00:57:12,746 --> 00:57:15,874
Are you, or are you not
the watchman of the cemetery?

452
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:17,668
Well, of course I am.

453
00:57:17,876 --> 00:57:20,838
You are therefore an engineer. By the way,

454
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:25,926
which of these do you think
would be better on my tombstone?

455
00:57:31,515 --> 00:57:32,850
Both.

456
00:57:33,058 --> 00:57:37,146
I like the opinion of
a handsome young man.

457
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:39,231
Good-bye, engineer.

458
00:57:44,528 --> 00:57:47,614
- Gna!
- Good morning, cutie.

459
00:58:04,756 --> 00:58:06,633
But that's the phone book.

460
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:08,510
Are you crazy?

461
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,471
That is my favourite reading!

462
00:58:13,432 --> 00:58:15,309
Gnaghi, just because
we've got the new ones

463
00:58:15,517 --> 00:58:19,354
doesn't mean to say we have to throw the
old ones away. These books are classics!

464
00:58:24,693 --> 00:58:26,028
Gnaghi!

465
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:27,654
Gna!

466
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:58,560
Stop killing the dead.

467
00:58:58,977 --> 00:59:00,562
They're mine.

468
00:59:00,771 --> 00:59:04,024
If you don't want the
dead coming back to life...

469
00:59:04,316 --> 00:59:07,361
why don't you just kill the living,

470
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:08,779
shoot them in the head?

471
00:59:09,321 --> 00:59:11,532
Are you listening to me?

472
00:59:28,215 --> 00:59:30,259
- Hello?
- Greetings from the Tomb oft the Town Hall.

473
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:32,052
- Franco! How are you?
- Bored.

474
00:59:32,261 --> 00:59:33,929
Am I disturbing you?

475
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:35,681
No, you never disturb me.

476
00:59:35,889 --> 00:59:38,517
Just called to talk about the scandal.

477
00:59:38,725 --> 00:59:40,686
- Gnaghi, the door!
- All that crap.

478
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:41,854
What did you say?

479
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:46,024
What the hell was that?

480
00:59:46,233 --> 00:59:47,276
Nothing, I'm...

481
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:48,735
- ...just working.
- What?

482
00:59:48,944 --> 00:59:51,655
You know, daily grind.
Nothing but the daily grind.

483
00:59:51,864 --> 00:59:54,366
You're telling me! Sometimes,
I feel like shooting myself.

484
00:59:56,535 --> 00:59:58,203
How's everything in your life?

485
00:59:58,412 --> 01:00:00,455
How are dear Mara and Cinzia?

486
01:00:03,417 --> 01:00:06,545
You know, sometimes I wonder
if they really exist, Franco.

487
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:14,011
I mean, you do have a wife
and a daughter, don't you?

488
01:00:19,057 --> 01:00:24,021
I only ask 'cause... sometimes
I think you've made it all up.

489
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:34,740
Franco, you do make me laugh!

490
01:00:39,495 --> 01:00:41,371
You'll get out one day.

491
01:00:41,788 --> 01:00:46,502
Buffalora will be
nothing but a bad, bad memory.

492
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:49,713
Yeah, or maybe not, if
only I could get unstuck...

493
01:00:49,922 --> 01:00:52,424
I feel like a fly on fly paper.

494
01:00:53,258 --> 01:00:54,927
You'll see, Franco...

495
01:00:57,137 --> 01:01:01,266
Mara is going to get tired of you,

496
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:05,521
and Cinzia will grow up to hate you.

497
01:01:05,729 --> 01:01:07,564
Then you'll be free.

498
01:01:08,816 --> 01:01:12,027
Free to see what the rest
of the world looks like.

499
01:01:13,195 --> 01:01:16,198
What do you think the rest
of the world looks like?

500
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:19,034
- The rest of the world?
- Uh-uh.

501
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:25,249
Who knows if the rest of
the world even exists...

502
01:01:37,886 --> 01:01:38,720
Look who it is!

503
01:01:39,054 --> 01:01:40,305
Hey, Dellamorte, come here!

504
01:02:24,308 --> 01:02:27,311
At times, I get ahead of my work.

505
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:29,897
Work!

506
01:02:38,906 --> 01:02:40,365
Dellamorte!

507
01:02:44,244 --> 01:02:46,079
Dellamorte!

508
01:02:47,915 --> 01:02:49,416
Gnaghi!

509
01:02:57,257 --> 01:02:59,343
Francesco Dellamorte?

510
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:02,971
Where were you between
11 and 12:30 last night?

511
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:04,848
In bed.

512
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,434
Any witnesses?

513
01:03:12,606 --> 01:03:16,443
I was talking to my friend Franco
on the telephone and I fell asleep.

514
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,195
Why, what happened?

515
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:21,198
Some fucking maniac
killed 7 people in town.

516
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,539
More work.

517
01:03:29,331 --> 01:03:32,459
Well, you got to go to jail,
unless you have an alibi!

518
01:03:32,709 --> 01:03:34,044
Why me?

519
01:03:34,378 --> 01:03:38,632
Because your car was seen driving
around the streets last night, that's why.

520
01:03:40,008 --> 01:03:42,386
That's impossible, no one
can drive that wreck apart from me.

521
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:45,472
Actually, I don't think it was you.

522
01:03:45,681 --> 01:03:47,599
I think it was your assistant.

523
01:03:48,350 --> 01:03:50,644
Gnaghi can't even roller-skate!

524
01:03:50,936 --> 01:03:52,729
Neither can I, so what?

525
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,524
I want to question him immediately.

526
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:08,579
God, the weather's gone bad.

527
01:04:20,132 --> 01:04:21,675
Please,

528
01:04:22,301 --> 01:04:23,468
let me talk to him first.

529
01:04:23,677 --> 01:04:26,597
Just tell him to come
right out, will you?

530
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:35,481
Don't you ever clean that
place? Jesus Christ, it stinks!

531
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:41,653
# When all is sad, when you're
alone, it feels so bad.

532
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:47,826
# You wait again for love to start,
to feel the beating of the heart. #

533
01:05:00,255 --> 01:05:02,216
Gnaghi!

534
01:05:03,091 --> 01:05:05,135
Gnaghi, I had a terrible dream last night,

535
01:05:05,344 --> 01:05:08,305
I dreamt I went to town
and killed 7 real people.

536
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:10,724
Hi, remember me?

537
01:05:11,266 --> 01:05:14,269
Dellamorte, you've
got important visitors!

538
01:05:19,983 --> 01:05:22,694
You'll understand, engineer, after this massacre,

539
01:05:22,903 --> 01:05:24,488
the voters are furious with me.

540
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:27,908
They've been voting
for you for 15 years.

541
01:05:28,242 --> 01:05:30,410
If I don't find this maniac, Straniero,

542
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:32,621
there won't be a sixteenth.

543
01:05:34,623 --> 01:05:36,667
What's your daughter got to do with it?

544
01:05:36,792 --> 01:05:38,752
Now that the whole town is in mourning,

545
01:05:38,961 --> 01:05:42,172
I want to show them
that I'm grieving as well.

546
01:05:42,381 --> 01:05:44,925
I'll have some pictures
taken of the body

547
01:05:45,133 --> 01:05:47,845
and put a blow-up on
my election posters.

548
01:05:48,262 --> 01:05:50,013
And underneath, something like:

549
01:05:50,430 --> 01:05:53,142
"if you've had a death in the family,

550
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:57,229
vote for someone who suffers like you."

551
01:05:57,437 --> 01:05:58,897
What do you think?

552
01:05:59,273 --> 01:06:01,900
Well, you know, it's a thought!

553
01:06:02,317 --> 01:06:04,403
Or: "Vote

554
01:06:04,736 --> 01:06:06,905
for a man who has lost

555
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:10,367
all other happiness."

556
01:06:18,917 --> 01:06:20,919
Ready to shoot?

557
01:06:25,799 --> 01:06:28,177
So what do I do? Take
one from the neck down?

558
01:06:28,468 --> 01:06:29,970
Engineer?

559
01:06:30,262 --> 01:06:32,139
What's the meaning of this?

560
01:06:33,932 --> 01:06:35,726
Daddy!

561
01:06:36,018 --> 01:06:37,478
Daddykin!

562
01:06:37,728 --> 01:06:38,729
Did you hear that?

563
01:06:38,937 --> 01:06:40,689
I don't know. It depends...

564
01:06:40,898 --> 01:06:42,774
Daddypie!

565
01:06:43,317 --> 01:06:45,194
Daddypooh!

566
01:06:45,486 --> 01:06:47,070
Valentina!

567
01:06:47,488 --> 01:06:49,031
Pumpkin!

568
01:06:53,118 --> 01:06:54,661
The plot thickens!

569
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:57,414
Pumpkin, where are you?

570
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,209
Where are you?

571
01:07:02,085 --> 01:07:04,046
Your Daddy's here!

572
01:07:05,005 --> 01:07:06,548
Where are you?

573
01:07:06,757 --> 01:07:09,259
Stop blabbering and come on in!

574
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:15,766
Coming.

575
01:07:20,521 --> 01:07:22,523
Here I am, little one.

576
01:07:25,442 --> 01:07:27,110
Jesus, it stinks in here!

577
01:07:27,319 --> 01:07:28,362
It's my fault, daddy!

578
01:07:30,447 --> 01:07:32,324
Oh my God, Valentina!

579
01:07:32,825 --> 01:07:34,910
What are you doing on TV?

580
01:07:35,035 --> 01:07:37,204
I'm rotting fast, Daddy!

581
01:07:37,412 --> 01:07:39,915
You, stuttering monster,

582
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:42,000
you're the one who hurt my little girl!

583
01:07:42,334 --> 01:07:44,086
No, he loves me!

584
01:07:44,503 --> 01:07:45,921
Step aside!

585
01:07:46,129 --> 01:07:47,631
I command you, as your Mayor!

586
01:07:47,756 --> 01:07:50,467
With your consent, I'd
like to marry Gnaghi.

587
01:07:52,219 --> 01:07:54,096
- This horrible thing?
- Gna!

588
01:07:54,847 --> 01:07:57,015
I'm not such a great
catch either, Daddy.

589
01:07:57,432 --> 01:08:00,269
Not as long, dear, as I've
got a breath in my body!

590
01:08:00,978 --> 01:08:03,897
Alright. We'll fix that right away!

591
01:08:19,246 --> 01:08:21,790
Help me, engineer!

592
01:08:21,999 --> 01:08:23,959
I'm not an engineer!

593
01:08:40,893 --> 01:08:42,519
I'm sorry Gnaghi,

594
01:08:42,978 --> 01:08:44,688
she really was beginning to...

595
01:08:44,897 --> 01:08:47,274
go off a bit on that, wasn't she?

596
01:08:53,947 --> 01:08:55,115
He's dead?

597
01:09:02,498 --> 01:09:03,665
He's dead.

598
01:09:03,957 --> 01:09:05,959
Who took a bite out of his neck?

599
01:09:06,168 --> 01:09:07,586
Well, not me or Gnaghi,

600
01:09:07,794 --> 01:09:09,713
Take a mould of our teeth.

601
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:11,340
You'll see they won't match.

602
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:12,382
And who did it?

603
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:15,761
Oh, relax Straniero. This won't be
your first unsolved case, will it?

604
01:09:17,471 --> 01:09:18,680
Hold it!

605
01:09:25,354 --> 01:09:26,897
Oh, come on, Gnaghi...

606
01:09:27,523 --> 01:09:30,776
The world's full of girls like
that, and they've got bodies, too.

607
01:09:33,612 --> 01:09:34,988
By the way,

608
01:09:35,447 --> 01:09:38,033
do you know what my
mother's maiden name was?

609
01:09:39,409 --> 01:09:41,495
You'd never believe it if I told you.

610
01:09:42,246 --> 01:09:44,790
She was called Dellamore.

611
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:47,042
Dellamore.

612
01:09:48,168 --> 01:09:50,170
That means "love"...

613
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:55,509
You're not the only person in the
world who's lost a lover, Gnaghi.

614
01:10:11,441 --> 01:10:12,776
Get down!

615
01:10:13,819 --> 01:10:15,571
What do you think? Get down from there!

616
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:17,906
Forget it, engineer!

617
01:10:18,532 --> 01:10:20,159
Go home!

618
01:10:20,367 --> 01:10:21,827
You're supposed to be
setting a good example,

619
01:10:22,035 --> 01:10:24,288
now will you get back to
your coffin immediately!

620
01:10:24,538 --> 01:10:26,456
You can't stop me,

621
01:10:26,623 --> 01:10:29,042
you owe your job to me.

622
01:10:29,251 --> 01:10:32,421
- Remember?
- Get down or I'll shoot.

623
01:10:32,671 --> 01:10:34,131
You can't.

624
01:10:34,339 --> 01:10:36,508
I'm the Mayor!

625
01:10:36,884 --> 01:10:38,385
Ex!

626
01:10:56,153 --> 01:10:58,405
- Mr. Dellamorte?
- What?

627
01:10:58,614 --> 01:11:00,532
I'm Civardi, the new Mayor.

628
01:11:01,575 --> 01:11:03,160
Why the barbed wire?

629
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:04,828
Do they climb in at night?

630
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,414
No, they climb out, sometimes.

631
01:11:08,457 --> 01:11:10,042
Would you mind coming down?

632
01:11:10,959 --> 01:11:13,879
You reported an epidemic
which affects the dead.

633
01:11:14,713 --> 01:11:16,715
You claim they come to life

634
01:11:16,924 --> 01:11:19,051
within seven days of burial.

635
01:11:19,468 --> 01:11:23,806
- It says so, right here.
- An M3 report.

636
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:26,183
- Didn’t you fill it out?
- No.

637
01:11:26,517 --> 01:11:28,894
Oh, splendid.

638
01:11:29,102 --> 01:11:31,939
So you'll provide us with a denial.

639
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,193
Just sign here.

640
01:11:37,152 --> 01:11:38,821
Franco must have sent it.

641
01:11:39,029 --> 01:11:40,697
What a nice thought.

642
01:11:42,574 --> 01:11:44,326
Nothing happened.

643
01:11:45,494 --> 01:11:46,954
Nothing ever happens.

644
01:11:47,162 --> 01:11:49,873
If the press got hold
of something like this,

645
01:11:50,082 --> 01:11:52,668
not only would Buffalora
be a laughing stock,

646
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:55,295
but you'd lose your job.

647
01:11:56,547 --> 01:11:58,507
My personal secretary.

648
01:11:58,632 --> 01:12:00,926
- Mr. Dellamorte.
- A pleasure.

649
01:12:01,134 --> 01:12:02,678
A real pleasure, Mr. Dellamorte.

650
01:12:02,803 --> 01:12:04,054
Thank you.

651
01:12:04,471 --> 01:12:06,849
You and I are going
to get along just fine.

652
01:12:07,391 --> 01:12:08,100
Good-bye.

653
01:12:17,818 --> 01:12:18,735
Your name!

654
01:12:19,361 --> 01:12:21,238
I didn't get your name...

655
01:12:36,879 --> 01:12:38,964
Will I see her again?

656
01:12:51,059 --> 01:12:52,686
Hi!

657
01:12:57,024 --> 01:12:58,484
I'm sorry.

658
01:12:59,943 --> 01:13:01,695
I didn't mean to frighten you, Miss.

659
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,449
I was expecting someone else.

660
01:13:06,283 --> 01:13:09,369
Miss! Miss!

661
01:13:23,175 --> 01:13:24,968
Ever since I got to Buffalora,

662
01:13:25,177 --> 01:13:27,763
strange things have
been happening to me.

663
01:13:28,514 --> 01:13:30,599
It's as if I've been here before.

664
01:13:31,016 --> 01:13:32,684
And that grave...

665
01:13:32,893 --> 01:13:36,772
And you, Mr. Dellamorte, it's as if

666
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:38,899
I've known you forever.

667
01:13:39,858 --> 01:13:42,277
As if I've loved you forever!

668
01:13:46,031 --> 01:13:47,366
You love me, too?

669
01:13:49,243 --> 01:13:50,202
Why?

670
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:52,371
Who else is there?

671
01:13:55,833 --> 01:13:57,543
I love you as well.

672
01:13:58,752 --> 01:14:00,003
I love you.

673
01:14:05,634 --> 01:14:07,803
I've heard what they
say about you in town.

674
01:14:08,345 --> 01:14:10,097
Is it true that you don't...

675
01:14:10,305 --> 01:14:13,058
I mean, that you can't...

676
01:14:13,267 --> 01:14:15,435
No, you don't wanna
believe town gossip.

677
01:14:15,644 --> 01:14:18,772
Because I can only love an impotent man.

678
01:14:21,358 --> 01:14:23,777
Yeah, it's true. It's true.

679
01:14:23,986 --> 01:14:25,237
I like men...

680
01:14:27,614 --> 01:14:30,742
but their manhood terrifies me.

681
01:14:31,785 --> 01:14:34,705
I can't stand the thought
of them having a...

682
01:14:35,414 --> 01:14:38,250
I mean... you understand?

683
01:14:40,335 --> 01:14:42,212
It's a sort of phobia I have.

684
01:14:42,838 --> 01:14:46,466
I don't have one, I don't
have anything at all.

685
01:14:47,342 --> 01:14:48,385
Will you marry me?

686
01:15:19,958 --> 01:15:21,752
I'm getting married!

687
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:22,878
Gna!

688
01:15:24,463 --> 01:15:25,881
I'm really getting married!

689
01:15:26,089 --> 01:15:27,508
Don't pretend you
didn't hear everything.

690
01:15:27,716 --> 01:15:29,009
Gna!

691
01:15:29,259 --> 01:15:30,803
Yeah? Why not?

692
01:15:31,011 --> 01:15:32,387
Go ahead, explain...

693
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:37,059
God gracious...

694
01:15:37,267 --> 01:15:38,310
What are you saying?

695
01:15:38,519 --> 01:15:39,895
You heard me!

696
01:15:40,187 --> 01:15:41,772
My dear boy,

697
01:15:42,064 --> 01:15:46,235
you must be very run down.
I'm going to give you some pills.

698
01:15:47,694 --> 01:15:50,614
Dr Vercesi, I'm serious.

699
01:15:51,573 --> 01:15:53,867
Look, I'm not going to be
intimidated in my own surgery.

700
01:15:54,159 --> 01:15:55,202
That waiting room there

701
01:15:55,410 --> 01:15:57,913
is full of people with good,
honest diseases.

702
01:15:58,121 --> 01:15:59,081
I'll pay you...

703
01:16:01,458 --> 01:16:02,709
Yes I know, but...

704
01:16:04,503 --> 01:16:06,588
How can I? I mean,
everybody knows that...

705
01:16:07,297 --> 01:16:08,549
you haven't got one.

706
01:16:21,603 --> 01:16:26,066
I see. You have got one.

707
01:16:26,275 --> 01:16:30,028
When would you like me
to relieve you of your...

708
01:16:30,571 --> 01:16:32,531
- ...problem?
- Now.

709
01:16:54,970 --> 01:16:57,181
What are you waiting
for? Get on with it!

710
01:17:10,194 --> 01:17:11,528
Now what?

711
01:17:18,869 --> 01:17:20,704
I told you I don't want an anaesthetic.

712
01:17:20,913 --> 01:17:21,955
It's not an anaesthetic.

713
01:17:22,164 --> 01:17:23,415
What is it, then?

714
01:17:24,374 --> 01:17:27,878
One shot of this, it'll be
as if you've never had one.

715
01:17:28,337 --> 01:17:30,172
It lasts for over a month.

716
01:17:30,714 --> 01:17:33,425
Look... please don't
make me cut it away.

717
01:17:33,634 --> 01:17:35,803
Today I'm just not up to it.

718
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:39,431
What are you doing, turning over?

719
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:41,141
I have to give you
the shot in the front.

720
01:17:41,558 --> 01:17:42,518
Front where?

721
01:17:43,435 --> 01:17:46,980
Hold still, I'll just make a puncture.

722
01:18:15,342 --> 01:18:17,344
That fucking butcher

723
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:20,722
has given me some kind of infection.

724
01:18:22,141 --> 01:18:23,392
Gnaghi!

725
01:18:24,226 --> 01:18:26,812
I'm hovering between life and death.

726
01:18:27,020 --> 01:18:28,188
Gna!

727
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:30,566
Yeah, you're right.

728
01:18:30,774 --> 01:18:32,860
I suppose I'm used to this condition.

729
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:40,200
That's her. Don't let her
in. Tell her I'm not here.

730
01:18:40,409 --> 01:18:42,494
I don't want her to see me like this.

731
01:18:50,502 --> 01:18:52,504
- I must see Mr. Dellamorte.
- Gna!

732
01:18:52,713 --> 01:18:56,341
Please, I've got to speak
to him, is he in there?

733
01:18:58,427 --> 01:19:00,762
I'd give my life to be dead.

734
01:19:04,683 --> 01:19:06,143
Gnaghi!

735
01:19:06,351 --> 01:19:08,020
It doesn't hurt anymore.

736
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,189
I think I'm better.

737
01:19:13,525 --> 01:19:14,693
Gna!

738
01:19:15,194 --> 01:19:16,570
When did t happen?

739
01:19:22,201 --> 01:19:23,744
She was our nicest client.

740
01:19:24,495 --> 01:19:26,580
The best always die first.

741
01:19:26,788 --> 01:19:27,831
Gna!

742
01:19:47,643 --> 01:19:50,562
Where have you been?
I thought I'd go mad.

743
01:19:50,979 --> 01:19:53,065
If you only knew what happened to me.

744
01:19:53,273 --> 01:19:54,942
If you only knew what happened to me...

745
01:19:56,193 --> 01:19:58,278
I must talk to you.

746
01:20:01,824 --> 01:20:03,700
We'll always be together.

747
01:20:03,909 --> 01:20:05,786
Yes, my love, yes.

748
01:20:08,914 --> 01:20:11,416
I don't know how to say this, but

749
01:20:11,625 --> 01:20:14,169
- the Mayor raped me.
- No!

750
01:20:14,378 --> 01:20:17,256
Wait! I liked it.

751
01:20:17,339 --> 01:20:18,924
Not the violence, no.

752
01:20:19,132 --> 01:20:21,927
But after that, we did it again nicely,

753
01:20:22,136 --> 01:20:24,972
so that I'd forgive him.

754
01:20:25,806 --> 01:20:28,809
It was wonderful, do you understand?

755
01:20:29,143 --> 01:20:33,522
That means I'm cured. I
don't have a phobia anymore.

756
01:20:34,857 --> 01:20:36,942
I can't marry you, now.

757
01:20:39,444 --> 01:20:41,321
I'm going to marry him.

758
01:20:42,364 --> 01:20:44,658
That doesn't mean
anything though, I mean,

759
01:20:44,992 --> 01:20:48,328
nothing's changed
between us, I still love you.

760
01:20:48,829 --> 01:20:50,205
You know that.

761
01:20:50,831 --> 01:20:55,002
I just love you in a different
way, but you're important to me.

762
01:20:56,044 --> 01:20:59,673
He knows, I mean, about you and me.

763
01:21:00,215 --> 01:21:01,675
He's a wonderful man,

764
01:21:01,884 --> 01:21:03,844
he said he's happy we can be friends.

765
01:21:03,969 --> 01:21:06,054
We can still see each other.

766
01:21:06,472 --> 01:21:08,223
Nothing's changed.

767
01:21:08,974 --> 01:21:11,268
Everything's just as it was.

768
01:21:13,645 --> 01:21:14,897
Everything.

769
01:21:34,500 --> 01:21:38,170
You look for Death in the clear night,

770
01:21:39,296 --> 01:21:41,715
you tell her you still love her,

771
01:21:42,633 --> 01:21:44,843
that you are her slave,

772
01:21:45,761 --> 01:21:47,846
that she's still your queen.

773
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:50,140
Death, Death,

774
01:21:51,308 --> 01:21:53,268
Death, the whore.

775
01:22:05,697 --> 01:22:07,866
No, I'd only do it for the fear

776
01:22:08,826 --> 01:22:10,994
and I'd come back

777
01:22:11,203 --> 01:22:14,122
just to experience the same fear again.

778
01:22:15,165 --> 01:22:16,750
To be afraid,

779
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:20,087
always to be afraid.

780
01:22:28,220 --> 01:22:29,263
Hi!

781
01:22:30,597 --> 01:22:34,143
Is that white VW outside yours?

782
01:22:37,062 --> 01:22:38,647
We're on foot.

783
01:22:39,148 --> 01:22:41,233
Could you give us a lift?

784
01:22:41,984 --> 01:22:43,235
It's not very far.

785
01:22:44,987 --> 01:22:46,655
Go on!

786
01:22:48,532 --> 01:22:49,700
I'm Magda.

787
01:22:52,077 --> 01:22:54,705
And this is Laura.

788
01:23:02,296 --> 01:23:03,839
How far is it?

789
01:23:10,137 --> 01:23:12,723
This is where we live,
with another girlfriend.

790
01:23:21,482 --> 01:23:24,109
Do you want to come up for a drink?

791
01:23:25,027 --> 01:23:28,530
Come on, you're not afraid
of two college girls, are you?

792
01:23:32,534 --> 01:23:36,747
Make a wish. I grant wishes.

793
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:40,876
I want you to fall in love with me.

794
01:23:46,924 --> 01:23:49,218
But I'm already in love with you.

795
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,637
Haven't you noticed?

796
01:23:58,101 --> 01:24:00,187
It's cold in here.

797
01:24:03,398 --> 01:24:06,026
If you'd like to wash,
there's a sink there.

798
01:24:22,376 --> 01:24:24,878
I didn't mean your face, silly!

799
01:24:25,838 --> 01:24:28,298
I don't know whether I can do it.

800
01:24:28,549 --> 01:24:30,509
I've been taking some medication...

801
01:24:42,396 --> 01:24:45,023
I don't think your
medication is working!

802
01:25:00,539 --> 01:25:01,999
Do you love me?

803
01:25:04,293 --> 01:25:05,544
Yes,

804
01:25:05,961 --> 01:25:07,963
if you stay all night.

805
01:25:09,715 --> 01:25:11,717
All my life, too.

806
01:25:17,222 --> 01:25:20,476
- Come on!
- Let's rest a bit.

807
01:25:20,559 --> 01:25:22,227
- Why?
- You've come three times already.

808
01:25:22,561 --> 01:25:24,938
Twice. The third one was faked.

809
01:25:34,114 --> 01:25:36,200
She's sleeping, she's
been studying all day.

810
01:25:36,533 --> 01:25:38,619
she's got an exam tomorrow morning.

811
01:25:38,911 --> 01:25:41,955
I just wanted to get some wine.

812
01:25:42,164 --> 01:25:43,499
Sit down.

813
01:25:43,916 --> 01:25:45,501
I'll get you some.

814
01:26:01,975 --> 01:26:05,187
Did Laura tell you you can pay me?

815
01:26:05,813 --> 01:26:06,563
Pay you?

816
01:26:06,647 --> 01:26:08,857
School’s expensive, my friend.

817
01:26:10,609 --> 01:26:11,568
I have to pay you?

818
01:26:12,277 --> 01:26:13,737
We don't have a scholarship, you know.

819
01:26:15,614 --> 01:26:18,116
Besides, it's only 100,000 lira.

820
01:26:20,327 --> 01:26:22,079
She told me she loved me...

821
01:26:23,455 --> 01:26:25,415
That's 150,000.

822
01:26:26,166 --> 01:26:27,709
She wants me to stay the night.

823
01:26:28,335 --> 01:26:30,212
200,000.

824
01:26:30,838 --> 01:26:32,214
Is a cheque all right?

825
01:26:32,506 --> 01:26:34,383
It's money, isn't it?

826
01:26:36,051 --> 01:26:37,845
Hurry, darling.

827
01:26:38,053 --> 01:26:40,139
I'm cold.

828
01:26:40,556 --> 01:26:42,516
Come and warm me up.

829
01:26:44,726 --> 01:26:47,312
I need your warmth.

830
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:50,440
Warm me up.

831
01:26:51,275 --> 01:26:52,860
Coming, love.

832
01:26:57,739 --> 01:26:59,324
Now you'll be warm forever.

833
01:27:27,895 --> 01:27:30,063
This time I'm really through with love.

834
01:27:52,377 --> 01:27:55,506
I bet you'd like to know where I was
between 1 and 3 last night, wouldn't you?

835
01:27:55,631 --> 01:27:57,174
I know, I know.

836
01:27:57,508 --> 01:27:59,676
Here we are. Have no fear,

837
01:27:59,802 --> 01:28:01,345
I won't tell anybody about this cheque,

838
01:28:01,553 --> 01:28:03,347
this is the reason I came here.

839
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:05,933
We're both worldly men, aren't we?

840
01:28:07,518 --> 01:28:09,978
- But this could be proof against...
- Proof against whom?

841
01:28:10,187 --> 01:28:12,105
We've already arrested
the guilty party.

842
01:28:12,314 --> 01:28:14,066
After setting fire to the apartment,

843
01:28:14,274 --> 01:28:16,109
he went home, killed
his wife and daughter,

844
01:28:16,318 --> 01:28:20,823
then turned himself in. He's at
the hospital, the psychiatric ward.

845
01:28:22,616 --> 01:28:25,244
Somebody's stolen my crimes!

846
01:28:37,131 --> 01:28:38,173
Sir?

847
01:28:39,091 --> 01:28:41,343
Excuse me, this section
is closed to the public.

848
01:28:41,552 --> 01:28:42,719
I've come to see the killer.

849
01:28:42,928 --> 01:28:45,264
But you can't go in
there. He's in a coma.

850
01:28:45,681 --> 01:28:47,474
He drank a whole bottle of iodine.

851
01:28:47,683 --> 01:28:49,601
I have to take his measurements.

852
01:28:52,229 --> 01:28:53,856
Franco!

853
01:28:58,735 --> 01:29:02,072
You looked a lot better the last
time we talked on the phone.

854
01:29:28,849 --> 01:29:29,975
Thief!

855
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:33,729
You're a thief...

856
01:29:35,189 --> 01:29:39,109
You may have killed your wife and
daughter, OK, I'll give you that,

857
01:29:39,318 --> 01:29:41,361
but it was me who knocked
off the three girls.

858
01:29:41,445 --> 01:29:43,947
What are you doing stealing my murders?

859
01:29:44,156 --> 01:29:46,366
What kind of fucking
friend do you think you are?

860
01:29:47,701 --> 01:29:50,037
Especially as you thought
you were doing me a favour.

861
01:29:50,245 --> 01:29:51,955
Put that out immediately!

862
01:29:52,164 --> 01:29:53,248
- Smoking is not allowed in here!
- Shut up!

863
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:01,089
He's in a coma. He doesn't even notice.

864
01:30:01,298 --> 01:30:02,841
Shit.

865
01:30:03,884 --> 01:30:05,385
What'd you say?

866
01:30:14,102 --> 01:30:16,772
Everything's shit.

867
01:30:16,897 --> 01:30:20,067
The only thing that's not shitty...

868
01:30:21,193 --> 01:30:23,028
is sleep.

869
01:30:23,237 --> 01:30:24,530
What are you doing on the floor, sister?

870
01:30:24,738 --> 01:30:25,781
She's praying.

871
01:30:26,198 --> 01:30:27,741
Friend of yours?

872
01:30:28,075 --> 01:30:31,620
Look, he hasn't got any relatives
and the coma he's in is irreversible.

873
01:30:31,829 --> 01:30:32,996
Give me a signature

874
01:30:33,288 --> 01:30:35,874
- and I'll pull the plug now.
- Fuck off!

875
01:30:51,306 --> 01:30:54,101
Here we go. Put it back in there.

876
01:30:55,185 --> 01:30:57,062
I won't let you die

877
01:30:57,688 --> 01:30:59,857
until you give me an explanation.

878
01:31:00,899 --> 01:31:02,776
Why did you steal my murders?

879
01:31:05,821 --> 01:31:08,782
Don't you think anything
I do counts? Huh?

880
01:31:09,032 --> 01:31:10,492
Oh, my God! What happened?

881
01:31:10,909 --> 01:31:14,329
They killed each other. It
was a settling of scores.

882
01:31:15,289 --> 01:31:16,665
Don't you believe me?

883
01:31:16,874 --> 01:31:18,167
- No!
- Tough.

884
01:31:23,755 --> 01:31:25,340
So bad...

885
01:31:29,678 --> 01:31:31,138
So,

886
01:31:31,555 --> 01:31:34,683
is that all you have any need
to say to your only friend?

887
01:31:39,062 --> 01:31:40,772
Who are you?

888
01:31:41,148 --> 01:31:43,192
I don't know you.

889
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,652
I don't know who you are.

890
01:31:45,944 --> 01:31:47,279
Go away.

891
01:31:48,655 --> 01:31:51,033
Go away!

892
01:32:07,007 --> 01:32:08,050
Dellamorte, wait.

893
01:32:08,675 --> 01:32:11,637
For God's sake, wait! There's
another maniac on the loose.

894
01:32:11,845 --> 01:32:13,722
He's on the 4th floor killing people.

895
01:32:13,931 --> 01:32:16,600
He already shot three.
You got a gun!

896
01:32:16,975 --> 01:32:18,894
That's good. Now you can defend yourself.

897
01:32:19,102 --> 01:32:22,189
Hey, take my advice and get
the hell out of here quick!

898
01:32:24,316 --> 01:32:25,692
Straniero!

899
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,361
It was me!

900
01:33:21,456 --> 01:33:23,041
You and I are both the same.

901
01:33:25,419 --> 01:33:27,713
We kill out of indifference,

902
01:33:28,881 --> 01:33:30,841
out of love sometimes,

903
01:33:34,303 --> 01:33:36,263
but never out of hate.

904
01:33:42,519 --> 01:33:45,022
Now I don't know who's dead or alive.

905
01:33:46,482 --> 01:33:47,733
I'm sick of killing.

906
01:33:50,861 --> 01:33:53,780
So I'm leaving the game, brother.

907
01:33:55,365 --> 01:33:58,160
Dellamorte Dellamore

908
01:33:58,494 --> 01:34:00,704
bids you farewell

909
01:34:01,205 --> 01:34:03,415
and is on his way.

910
01:34:03,999 --> 01:34:05,709
Where to?

911
01:34:10,798 --> 01:34:13,050
Better get out of here.

912
01:34:13,425 --> 01:34:15,761
Even the statue's talking.

913
01:34:17,763 --> 01:34:20,140
Where do you think you're going?

914
01:34:20,349 --> 01:34:22,893
if you haven't yet
understood the difference

915
01:34:23,101 --> 01:34:25,687
between life and me.

916
01:34:38,992 --> 01:34:41,328
Gnaghi, you're not bringing that!

917
01:34:46,291 --> 01:34:49,044
That coffin is not coming with us!

918
01:35:25,581 --> 01:35:28,125
Yeah, I missed that one. Don't
worry, I'll get the next one.

919
01:35:28,584 --> 01:35:31,837
Oh calm down. I know
every bump on this road.

920
01:35:34,256 --> 01:35:35,799
There's one!

921
01:35:39,386 --> 01:35:40,637
Look!

922
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:45,392
I'd never been this far.

923
01:35:47,394 --> 01:35:49,313
We made it, Gnaghi!

924
01:35:53,984 --> 01:35:56,153
Who could have imagined this?

925
01:35:56,361 --> 01:35:59,114
Wider than all the streets
of Buffalora put together.

926
01:35:59,823 --> 01:36:02,951
- It never seems to end!
- Gna!

927
01:36:04,912 --> 01:36:06,497
Hang on, Gnaghi.

928
01:36:07,331 --> 01:36:09,708
Past this tunnel is
the rest of the world.

929
01:36:19,718 --> 01:36:22,012
What do you think the rest of
the world looks like, Gnaghi?

930
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:24,431
Can you imagine it?

931
01:36:29,603 --> 01:36:32,773
You're right. It's beyond imagination.

932
01:37:25,909 --> 01:37:27,703
I should have known it.

933
01:37:30,622 --> 01:37:32,583
The rest of the world doesn't exist.

934
01:37:44,178 --> 01:37:45,095
Gnaghi!

935
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,891
Gnaghi, you weren't
hit that hard. Come on.

936
01:37:49,183 --> 01:37:51,226
Come on, I'll take you
to the car. Come on,

937
01:37:51,310 --> 01:37:52,853
Come on! Why are you going on
like this? You've just got cut.

938
01:37:53,061 --> 01:37:55,147
Come on man, get up,
I'll take you to the car!

939
01:37:55,355 --> 01:37:57,483
Come on! Come on, get up!

940
01:37:58,150 --> 01:38:00,319
What? What?

941
01:38:00,527 --> 01:38:01,695
Gnaghi!

942
01:38:05,240 --> 01:38:06,283
Gnaghi!

943
01:38:07,743 --> 01:38:11,663
Don't leave me alone
now. Gnaghi! Gnaghi!

944
01:38:14,833 --> 01:38:16,627
Oh God!

945
01:38:17,211 --> 01:38:18,045
Death,

946
01:38:18,462 --> 01:38:21,507
death, death comes sweeping down,

947
01:38:22,216 --> 01:38:24,968
filthy death the leering clown,

948
01:38:25,135 --> 01:38:27,930
death on wings, death by surprise,

949
01:38:28,138 --> 01:38:30,557
veiling evil from worldly eyes,

950
01:38:30,682 --> 01:38:32,226
death that's born

951
01:38:32,476 --> 01:38:34,853
as life succumbs, while death and love

952
01:38:35,062 --> 01:38:37,356
two kindred drums, beat the time

953
01:38:37,564 --> 01:38:39,233
till Judgement Day,

954
01:38:39,441 --> 01:38:40,484
an actor

955
01:38:40,567 --> 01:38:41,819
in a Passion Play,

956
01:38:42,069 --> 01:38:43,821
without beginning, without end,

957
01:38:44,655 --> 01:38:46,323
evermore.

958
01:38:46,532 --> 01:38:47,991
Amen.

959
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:15,936
You're my best friend.

960
01:39:18,939 --> 01:39:21,525
I didn't even realise it.

961
01:40:12,242 --> 01:40:13,911
Could you take me home?

962
01:40:14,203 --> 01:40:15,662
Please.

963
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:21,084
Gna.

964
