00:00:31,156 --> 00:00:35,068
I am Washakie,
of the great Shoshone Nation.

3
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,032
I wish to share with you
the story of Nick Wilson,

4
00:00:39,084 --> 00:00:45,467
or Yagaichi, as he is best
remembered
among the Shoshone people.

5
00:00:45,519 --> 00:00:48,127
The legend
of the white Indian boy

6
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:51,601
took place within our familiar
valleys and mountains,

7
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:54,855
known as "Wind River."

8
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:22,012
Yah!

9
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:51,009
Damn.

10
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:52,469
Shoshone.

11
00:03:56,558 --> 00:03:57,601
Aah!

12
00:04:46,834 --> 00:04:49,004
Yagaichi!

13
00:05:15,289 --> 00:05:17,292
He's a comin'.

14
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:33,596
Take him.

15
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:36,276
- Pretty good time.
- I’ve e been riding like hell.

16
00:05:38,028 --> 00:05:39,979
What happened to you?

17
00:05:40,031 --> 00:05:42,430
Shoshones.
Pocatello's band again.

18
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:44,829
- Did you get 'em?
- I didn't have to.

19
00:05:44,881 --> 00:05:46,498
You didn't have to?

20
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,293
Man: Kid, you ain't too smart
taking them Injuns lightly.

21
00:05:49,345 --> 00:05:51,259
Ain't gonna be
safe around here

22
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,121
until they're all
dead and buried.

23
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:55,760
Yeah, well, as I recall,
they were here first.

24
00:05:57,346 --> 00:06:00,558
Say, that's a nasty one,
we'd better take care of it.

25
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,509
There's a message
from your ma'.

26
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,731
There's some old woman
staying at your house

27
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:06,733
with a funny name.
Anaba?

28
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:08,695
Anuba.

29
00:06:09,862 --> 00:06:12,241
- Apparently...
- Don't take that! I got

30
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:13,200
to go to Grantsville!

31
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:18,770
Man: Nick. Nick.

32
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:21,128
N iii-iiick!

33
00:06:21,753 --> 00:06:22,255
Nick! Nick!

34
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,642
- Whoa!
- Hey! It's my turn!

35
00:06:33,937 --> 00:06:35,939
Whoa, aah!

36
00:06:39,903 --> 00:06:41,864
(both laughing)

37
00:06:49,499 --> 00:06:52,920
Nick: Someday I'd like to ride
a real fast horse.

38
00:06:52,972 --> 00:06:55,966
You have trouble
to ride the sheep.

39
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:58,053
Someday I'll be
a great rider.

40
00:06:58,105 --> 00:06:59,962
(laughing)

41
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:02,726
Maybe you could learn
on your muuda.

42
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:04,733
My what?

43
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:06,689
Muuda.

44
00:07:06,814 --> 00:07:09,558
I taught you.
Donkey.

45
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:12,217
I'd rather ride
a Bu... bungo,

46
00:07:12,269 --> 00:07:14,825
and be a great
Da... dagwahni.

47
00:07:16,912 --> 00:07:18,914
You learn fast.

48
00:07:18,997 --> 00:07:22,878
But white cannot be great
warriors. Only Indians.

49
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,970
Like my brothers
to the north.

50
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:29,011
I'll be
a great explorer then,

51
00:07:29,063 --> 00:07:30,889
like Louis and Clark.

52
00:07:31,014 --> 00:07:32,422
Anything
but a sheep-herder.

53
00:07:32,474 --> 00:07:36,939
The great Shoshones
of the Wind River.

54
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:40,902
My father ride with them.

55
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:44,929
He tell me
they scalp Crow and Sioux

56
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:47,787
while they ride
on their horses.

57
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,064
Golly.

58
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:50,289
Pantsuk,

59
00:07:50,498 --> 00:07:52,501
maybe we could
leave this place.

60
00:07:52,553 --> 00:07:54,410
We could run away.

61
00:07:54,462 --> 00:07:56,465
We could live
with your brothers in the north.

62
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,618
What about our families?

63
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,668
What about the sheep?

64
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,432
We can let Sylvester
take care of everything,

65
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:05,936
since he knows
so much.

66
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:10,734
Come on,
let's make a pact.

67
00:08:12,528 --> 00:08:16,022
What is pact?

68
00:08:16,074 --> 00:08:19,621
A promise...
or an agreement.

69
00:08:19,673 --> 00:08:21,707
Blood brothers.

70
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,836
Pact.

71
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:31,804
Lots of hunts,
and fishing.

72
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,641
We'll need horses and packs
for the trip.

73
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,812
And much jerky.

74
00:08:37,864 --> 00:08:40,013
That's for sure.

75
00:08:40,065 --> 00:08:43,695
Pantsuk, you're
my best tsaa hainj.

76
00:08:45,156 --> 00:08:47,867
You are
my best friend, too.

77
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:53,917
Aah! What'd you
do that for?

78
00:08:54,043 --> 00:08:56,003
I should do worse.
And you...

79
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,901
Why aren't you helping
your father?

80
00:08:57,953 --> 00:08:59,675
- Get goin'.
- Leave him alone.

81
00:08:59,727 --> 00:09:01,218
This is your job...

82
00:09:01,344 --> 00:09:03,587
to make sure the coyotes
don't kill the sheep.

83
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:06,643
When grown, that lamb
could have kept us for a month.

84
00:09:06,695 --> 00:09:08,468
If I ever catch you
slacking off again,

85
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,024
I'll kick your scrawny hide
to Salt Lake and back,

86
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:12,901
- you hear me?
- I can't do it all by myself.

87
00:09:16,447 --> 00:09:18,742
I hate this place.

88
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:52,454
(sobbing)

89
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,601
Washakie: Before the dreams,

90
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:10,635
My mother Anuba,

91
00:10:10,687 --> 00:10:13,607
a shaman and healer
among our people,

92
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:16,528
could not speak
for a very long time.

93
00:10:17,488 --> 00:10:22,286
A mighty avalanche had taken
her two sons, my brothers.

94
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:25,916
When mother started
having the visions,

95
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:28,128
the power was understood.

96
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,778
She knew the boy
in her dreams

97
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,178
was good medicine
for our nation.

98
00:10:34,261 --> 00:10:36,723
And we must find him.

99
00:10:36,775 --> 00:10:39,184
I sent my finest warrior,

100
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:41,478
Morogonai.

101
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:51,576
(calling)

102
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,569
- What are you looking at?
- Don't do that.

103
00:11:17,621 --> 00:11:20,156
You wanna wake the dead?
Then hush.

104
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:26,279
- What are you looking at?
- Shh!

105
00:11:26,331 --> 00:11:28,834
It's Louis and Clark
if you must know.

106
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,743
What's it about?

107
00:11:30,795 --> 00:11:33,569
It's about
Louis and Clark.

108
00:11:33,621 --> 00:11:36,344
- Who are they?
- Surveyors.

109
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:40,048
- What's surveyors?
- Explorers.

110
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,146
they mapped out all the western
territory with Sacajawea.

111
00:11:44,198 --> 00:11:46,149
She was a Shoshone.

112
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:48,590
Shoshones can scalp a person
with one hand

113
00:11:48,642 --> 00:11:50,947
- while riding a horse.
- they ride a horse

114
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:53,190
- with one hand?
- No,

115
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:56,308
- they scalp with one hand.
- How do you know?

116
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,375
I just do. Listen,
why are you so nosy, anyway?

117
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:01,378
You writing a book?

118
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,287
Shh, shh.

119
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,010
Why don't you just go to sleep
before you make me catch hell?

120
00:12:07,062 --> 00:12:08,210
Don't cuss, Nick.

121
00:12:08,262 --> 00:12:11,392
Never you mind.
Just go back to sleep.

122
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:13,503
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

123
00:12:13,555 --> 00:12:15,564
- Sleep tight.
- Okay.

124
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,233
Don't let
those bed bugs bite.

125
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:19,266
I'm gonna bite you.

126
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,488
- Prissy.
- 'Night, Nick.

127
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:55,826
(signaling)

128
00:13:12,098 --> 00:13:13,433
Nicholas.

129
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:17,877
(Nick, in haste)
Our Father, bless this food

130
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,556
so it may nourish
and strengthen our bodies

131
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:21,903
and do us the good we need.
We say these things in the name

132
00:13:21,955 --> 00:13:24,907
- of Jesus Christ, Amen.
- Amen.

133
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,993
I think you s et
a re cord.

134
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,560
Woman: Nicholas.

135
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:32,751
Criminy, Ma.

136
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,676
I think you boys
are turning into heathens.

137
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:43,130
It's hotter
than hell out there.

138
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:46,395
Sylvester, I don't want
any cussing in this house.

139
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:48,763
If your father were here...

140
00:13:48,815 --> 00:13:50,066
Who do you think
I learned it from?

141
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,644
I never saw ground
so full of rocks.

142
00:13:53,696 --> 00:13:55,907
Yeah, they must be
growing more every y ear.

143
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,703
Ma: Sylvester, your boots
are caked with mud.

144
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:00,706
Take them outside.

145
00:14:04,544 --> 00:14:06,693
Chicken coop
needs mending.

146
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:08,790
Chickens got out
last night.

147
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:11,136
Why you looking at me?
What about Jake?

148
00:14:11,188 --> 00:14:13,457
Just shut up
and mend the fence.

149
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:15,674
Can't. Got to
watch the sheep.

150
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:17,478
You'll watch the sheep
after you mend the fence.

151
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:18,855
Why can't you do it?

152
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:21,504
- I got to plow.
- Nick: I'll plow.

153
00:14:21,556 --> 00:14:24,018
- You ain't man enough.
- Yes, I am.

154
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:27,136
You don't even know how,
you dumb jackass.

155
00:14:27,188 --> 00:14:29,801
- That's enough of that.
- Just fix the fence!

156
00:14:29,853 --> 00:14:32,415
If I don't get them crops in,
you don't eat.

157
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:33,750
Nick: I wouldn't be
missing much.

158
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,170
- You ain't starving, are you?
- I might as well be!

159
00:14:36,222 --> 00:14:38,803
Stop it, you two!
I'll mend the fence.

160
00:14:38,855 --> 00:14:41,333
You got too much work.
Nick'll do it.

161
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:44,598
He does little else around here.
He'll do it after you eat.

162
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,132
- No!
- I said do it!

163
00:14:46,184 --> 00:14:47,852
You can't tell me what to do,
you're not my father!

164
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:49,605
I hate it here,
and I hate you!

165
00:14:51,065 --> 00:14:52,108
Eliza Nicholas!

166
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:03,123
When's father coming home?

167
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:05,250
Ma: Only
the Good Lord knows.

168
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:07,754
(chickens clucking)

169
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,648
Nicholas!

170
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:25,194
Nicholas, no!

171
00:15:25,246 --> 00:15:26,446
Yah!

172
00:15:28,323 --> 00:15:31,693
Nick: Whoa! Ahh!

173
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:35,834
Benjamin, stop!
Wait, Benjamin!

174
00:15:37,085 --> 00:15:40,215
Nick: Benjamin, stop!
Stop!

175
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,804
Sylvester: Nick, no!

176
00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:54,818
Nick: Help!
Benjamin stop, please stop!

177
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,695
Stop!

178
00:16:03,871 --> 00:16:05,123
Nick!

179
00:16:10,046 --> 00:16:11,089
Stop!

180
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,531
(thud)

181
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,842
Man: Our Father
who art in heaven,

182
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:47,430
hallowed be Thy name.

183
00:16:47,482 --> 00:16:49,558
Thy kingdom come,

184
00:16:49,683 --> 00:16:52,062
Thy will be done,
on earth,

185
00:16:52,114 --> 00:16:54,012
as it is in heaven.

186
00:16:54,064 --> 00:16:56,358
Give us this day
our daily bread,

187
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,601
and forgive us
our trespasses,

188
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:02,283
as we forgive those
who trespass against us,

189
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:04,495
and lead us not
into temptation,

190
00:17:04,547 --> 00:17:06,821
but deliver us from evil,

191
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:09,710
for Thine is the power,
and the kingdom,

192
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:13,256
and the glory,
forever. Amen.

193
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:17,846
We dedicate
this final resting place

194
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:23,302
as a place of peace
and tranquility,

195
00:17:23,354 --> 00:17:25,981
until the morning
of the first resurrection,

196
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:30,446
in Jesus' holy name,

197
00:17:30,498 --> 00:17:32,449
Amen.

198
00:17:35,161 --> 00:17:38,165
(man singing in
Native American language)

199
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,004
(crying)

200
00:19:14,044 --> 00:19:15,713
Stay back,
I'm warning you!

201
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:35,198
I'm not a yagaichi!

202
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:38,484
What you say?

203
00:19:38,536 --> 00:19:41,164
I said I'm not a crier.

204
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:47,193
You know Shoshone?

205
00:19:47,245 --> 00:19:50,009
No, just some Gosiute.

206
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:54,494
How you learn?

207
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:56,685
My friend.

208
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,712
Pantsuk.

209
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:02,443
Pantsuk.

210
00:20:07,533 --> 00:20:09,274
What are you
gonna do to me?

211
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:11,975
- Nick: You gonna scalp me?
- Scalp?

212
00:20:12,027 --> 00:20:14,625
Don't you scalp
white people sometimes?

213
00:20:14,677 --> 00:20:17,045
We scalp you?

214
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:40,775
Aaah! Ahh!

215
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:43,206
No! No y ell.
No y ell.

216
00:20:43,258 --> 00:20:46,043
I no scalp you.

217
00:20:46,095 --> 00:20:48,630
Be still.

218
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:52,385
You be still.

219
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:01,564
Look.

220
00:21:06,988 --> 00:21:10,805
You see him?
He stand tall.

221
00:21:10,857 --> 00:21:14,623
He strong.
You like him?

222
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,421
If you come with us,

223
00:21:19,473 --> 00:21:21,174
you keep him.

224
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,058
- You mean, just leave?
- He is fast.

225
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,936
Fast like the wind.

226
00:21:34,942 --> 00:21:36,893
Are you gonna kidnap me?

227
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:41,326
- Kidnap?
- Force me to go with you?

228
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:44,403
Force?
No, no, no.

229
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:47,459
No, no,
we no force you.

230
00:21:49,253 --> 00:21:52,173
We couldn't just go.
My mother would miss me.

231
00:21:52,225 --> 00:21:53,509
I couldn't hurt her
like that.

232
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:02,896
We will not take you.

233
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:05,316
Not take you.

234
00:22:06,234 --> 00:22:09,990
But, maybe...
maybe...

235
00:22:11,366 --> 00:22:14,287
the wind calls you,

236
00:22:15,204 --> 00:22:17,207
and you come.

237
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:20,753
If you feel

238
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:22,840

239
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,253

240
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,600
when the sun goes up.

241
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,897
If you no here,

242
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,067
we go.

243
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,089
You are chosen.

244
00:22:54,424 --> 00:22:56,459
Chosen.

245
00:22:56,511 --> 00:22:59,431
You come with us,

246
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:02,169
you ride this horse.

247
00:23:02,221 --> 00:23:04,855
You learn hunt good.

248
00:23:04,907 --> 00:23:08,010
You live life

249
00:23:08,062 --> 00:23:11,113
like a great man.

250
00:23:14,576 --> 00:23:16,329
Great man.

251
00:23:44,826 --> 00:23:47,955
Morogonai:
The wind calls you.

252
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:53,045
Pantsuk:
The great Shoshones

253
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:54,995
of the Wind River.

254
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:57,759
My father ride with them.

255
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:01,932
Ma: Nicholas!

256
00:24:04,102 --> 00:24:06,052
Ma: Nicholas!

257
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:09,108
Morogonai:
The wind calls you.

258
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:18,994
Female voice:
# close your eyes #

259
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:22,405
# And see #

260
00:25:22,457 --> 00:25:25,211
# A world awaits you #

261
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:27,865
# A road sets you free #

262
00:25:27,917 --> 00:25:30,468
# A journey will take you #

263
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,581
# To places unknown #

264
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:36,643
# When dreamers dream #

265
00:25:36,726 --> 00:25:39,804
# The legend goes #

266
00:25:39,856 --> 00:25:42,359
# It's then you'll know #

267
00:25:42,411 --> 00:25:44,429
# The wind calls #

268
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:46,447
# Your name... #

269
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,869
(horse whinnying)

270
00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:54,458
Can I call him Spirit?

271
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,618
Spirit?

272
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,048
Mmm, Spirit.

273
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:10,105
# The journey will take you #

274
00:26:10,157 --> 00:26:13,260
# To places unknown #

275
00:26:13,312 --> 00:26:16,152
# When dreamers dream #

276
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:18,940
# The legend goes #

277
00:26:18,992 --> 00:26:21,579
# It's then you'll know #

278
00:26:21,631 --> 00:26:23,581
# The wind calls #

279
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:27,210
# Your name #

280
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,217
# Take the time, #

281
00:26:32,269 --> 00:26:34,304
# Just be #

282
00:26:35,764 --> 00:26:38,434
# Beneath the stars, #

283
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:41,151
# Your night's canopy #

284
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:43,816
# A vision of future #

285
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,343
# The truth to behold #

286
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:50,785
# When dreamers dream, #

287
00:26:50,837 --> 00:26:53,361
# The legend goes #

288
00:26:53,413 --> 00:26:55,374
# It's then you'll know, #

289
00:26:55,426 --> 00:26:57,325
# The wind calls #

290
00:26:57,377 --> 00:27:00,506
- # Your name. #
- Whoa! Hey!

291
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,635
Hey, stop! Stop!

292
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:06,222
Stop!

293
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:08,850
Aaah!

294
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:16,934
This...

295
00:27:16,986 --> 00:27:19,647
no good way
to ride horse.

296
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:22,077
I know that, I told you,
I can't ride without a saddle.

297
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:24,497
You must learn.

298
00:27:26,457 --> 00:27:27,710
I want to go back.

299
00:27:27,835 --> 00:27:29,586
No.

300
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:31,881
You are scared...

301
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:35,636
to fall.

302
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:39,517
I will make it...

303
00:27:41,394 --> 00:27:43,480
I will fix it.

304
00:27:44,733 --> 00:27:46,693
U p.

305
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,657
Come on, up.

306
00:27:53,703 --> 00:27:56,290
Here, here.

307
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:02,339
Now, your feet
no dance.

308
00:28:14,439 --> 00:28:17,693
You no scared,
you no fall.

309
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,863
We must ride.

310
00:28:50,947 --> 00:28:52,771
We rest

311
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:56,162
when the sun goes down.

312
00:28:56,214 --> 00:28:58,164
Come.
(signaling)

313
00:29:07,343 --> 00:29:09,252
Man: All right, men.

314
00:29:09,304 --> 00:29:11,724
You know why we're here.
We're looking for the boy.

315
00:29:11,776 --> 00:29:13,043
All right?

316
00:29:13,095 --> 00:29:14,311
Sylvester,

317
00:29:14,436 --> 00:29:16,398
why don't you take
those first three men,

318
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:18,223
and head out on top
of the ridge?

319
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:20,465
You two men take the bottom,
and the rest of you

320
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,656
follow me through the canyon
and we'll fan out.

321
00:29:22,708 --> 00:29:25,159
Let's go get him.
Move out.

322
00:29:39,762 --> 00:29:43,308
Stop, please stop.

323
00:30:19,816 --> 00:30:21,901
(crying)

324
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,936
Ohh.

325
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,617
- Why you not talking?
- I did!

326
00:30:26,669 --> 00:30:28,495
You didn't hear.

327
00:30:37,673 --> 00:30:38,925
Come down.

328
00:31:07,713 --> 00:31:09,883
How you say?
Take off this,

329
00:31:10,008 --> 00:31:12,303
take off this.

330
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:15,516
Aaah!
It's stuck.

331
00:31:19,397 --> 00:31:22,526
- Sit down.
- What did he say?

332
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:25,863
He say you...

333
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:28,367
very brave.

334
00:31:33,874 --> 00:31:35,960
We must cut off
your legs.

335
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:39,632
- Don't cut my legs off!
- No, no, we must cut off...

336
00:31:39,684 --> 00:31:42,307
not your legs,

337
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:44,930
your pants.

338
00:31:48,394 --> 00:31:51,398
Morogonai: Okay.
Be still.

339
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:53,400
Aaah!

340
00:31:55,778 --> 00:31:58,407
Be strong. Strong.

341
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:09,130
(fabric ripping)

342
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:04,120
And your leg?

343
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:05,998
It hurts.

344
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:09,002
We need sleep.

345
00:33:11,005 --> 00:33:14,426
We must ride
when the sun goes up.

346
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:30,489
I don't want to go.

347
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:44,800
Then you keep.

348
00:33:48,848 --> 00:33:50,891
What's it for?

349
00:33:50,943 --> 00:33:52,936
Mountain lion.

350
00:33:56,566 --> 00:34:00,061
And coyotes.
Many.

351
00:34:00,113 --> 00:34:03,659
Also, many Crow Indians.

352
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,779
This Indian fast
and strong.

353
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:11,295
You need to keep
hiding in trees.

354
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:14,925
Crow Indian sees you,

355
00:34:16,176 --> 00:34:19,513
- kill you.
- Can't you take me back?

356
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:21,548
No.

357
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,689
Many white people
looking for us.

358
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,865
I am feel bad

359
00:34:33,824 --> 00:34:35,786
your leg.

360
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:43,088
When the sun
rises up,

361
00:34:46,342 --> 00:34:48,303
we go.

362
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:03,610
Who was that?

363
00:37:04,736 --> 00:37:07,104
Pocatello.

364
00:37:07,156 --> 00:37:10,525
He is Shoshone also.

365
00:37:10,577 --> 00:37:14,333
But he goes away from us.

366
00:37:14,385 --> 00:37:16,909
He is a leader

367
00:37:16,961 --> 00:37:19,673
among the people who...

368
00:37:19,725 --> 00:37:22,385
hate the white man.

369
00:37:23,637 --> 00:37:24,972
What did he say?

370
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:29,478
He want me
to make a trade...

371
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,049
you for two horses.

372
00:37:32,101 --> 00:37:34,569
What did you say?

373
00:37:34,621 --> 00:37:36,571
Not enough.

374
00:37:52,718 --> 00:37:54,804
Looks like
someone's clothes.

375
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,271
Man: What is it?

376
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:08,990
It's Nick's trousers.
There's blood on them.

377
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,205
Sylvester: Let's go.

378
00:38:15,665 --> 00:38:16,833
Yah!

379
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:25,470
Well, brother, we'd better
go after him. Come on.

380
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,390
- Yah!
- Yah!

381
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:49,461
(yelling signal)

382
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:08,650
This great man.

383
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:11,430
Washakie.

384
00:40:11,482 --> 00:40:14,106
He speak

385
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:16,453
for these people.

386
00:40:19,082 --> 00:40:22,503
You live with him.

387
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:31,056
This boy

388
00:40:35,437 --> 00:40:38,900
- Yagaichi?
- Yagaichi.

389
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:47,453
We have been waiting,
Yagaichi.

390
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:50,233
This woman

391
00:40:50,285 --> 00:40:52,909
Anuba.

392
00:40:52,961 --> 00:40:55,631
She's to be

393
00:40:55,683 --> 00:40:58,301
your mother.

394
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,779
Come.

395
00:41:12,831 --> 00:41:14,447
Come.

396
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:55,045
I have business
to attend to.

397
00:42:05,683 --> 00:42:07,770
This place is nice
and flat.

398
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:09,731
We'll camp here.

399
00:42:09,856 --> 00:42:11,941
It's not even sun down.
We got a good hour yet.

400
00:42:11,993 --> 00:42:14,445
We've been going
since sun up.

401
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,406
We'll camp here.

402
00:42:43,442 --> 00:42:46,447
Maybe if you aren't
so mad at it, it'll cooperate.

403
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:50,275
Sylvester,

404
00:42:50,327 --> 00:42:52,288
we're heading back
tomorrow.

405
00:42:55,626 --> 00:42:57,838
We've been at it 10 days,
and we ain't found

406
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,746
nothing
but those britches.

407
00:42:59,798 --> 00:43:02,510
Here could be anywhere
in these mountains,

408
00:43:02,562 --> 00:43:04,669
and he could be nowhere.

409
00:43:04,721 --> 00:43:06,683
We have families
we have to tend to,

410
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:09,050
and so do you.

411
00:43:09,102 --> 00:43:11,605
Your mother
needs you at home.

412
00:43:11,657 --> 00:43:13,567
We go back tomorrow.

413
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:51,824
Yagaichi.
Yagaichi.

414
00:44:51,876 --> 00:44:54,520
Oh, Yagaichi.

415
00:44:54,572 --> 00:44:57,164
(all laughing)

416
00:44:59,126 --> 00:45:00,533
Ahwo.

417
00:45:00,585 --> 00:45:05,592
- Ahwo.
- Ahwo? Ahwo.

418
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:07,595
Bowl.

419
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,464
Bowl.

420
00:45:10,516 --> 00:45:13,020
- Bowl.
- Bowl. Bowl.

421
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:21,573
Ehhe.

422
00:45:21,656 --> 00:45:24,368
Ehhe?
Ehhe. Ehhe.

423
00:45:25,327 --> 00:45:27,237
Blanket.

424
00:45:27,289 --> 00:45:28,957
- Blanket.
- Blan-ket.

425
00:45:29,082 --> 00:45:32,295
Yeah, you'll be speaking
English in no time.

426
00:45:32,347 --> 00:45:34,121
(wolf howling)

427
00:45:34,173 --> 00:45:36,593
What's the matter?
It's just an old wolf,

428
00:45:36,645 --> 00:45:39,805
- esa.
- Ha ah.

429
00:45:48,776 --> 00:45:51,696
I think my mother
would like you.

430
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:55,368
You're tough,
but you care.

431
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,277
My mother cares a lot.

432
00:45:57,329 --> 00:45:59,540
She's never really
that tough, though.

433
00:46:00,792 --> 00:46:02,753
It's hard on her.

434
00:46:06,716 --> 00:46:08,719
Anuba.

435
00:46:11,306 --> 00:46:13,392
Yagaichi.

436
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:15,463
Nick. Nick.

437
00:46:15,515 --> 00:46:17,481
Anuba, Nick.

438
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:21,393
Yagaichi.

439
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,407
- Nick!
- Yagaichi.

440
00:46:24,459 --> 00:46:27,370
- Nick!
- Yagaichi!

441
00:46:27,422 --> 00:46:29,372
Nick!

442
00:46:39,678 --> 00:46:43,015
Yagaichi.
Yagaichi.

443
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:52,821
(grunting)

444
00:46:57,952 --> 00:47:00,038
(grunting)

445
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:10,052
Ho.

446
00:47:15,768 --> 00:47:18,438
This...

447
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:20,931
ang...

448
00:47:20,983 --> 00:47:22,986
- an... ange... ang...
- Anger?

449
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:26,741
Anger. No.
Feet.

450
00:47:26,793 --> 00:47:29,661
Feet. Feet.

451
00:47:30,288 --> 00:47:32,196
Feet.

452
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:34,877
Feet, feet, head.

453
00:47:36,629 --> 00:47:39,467
Woooo, feet.
Do it.

454
00:47:40,176 --> 00:47:43,096
Do it. Feet.
Feet, feet.

455
00:47:43,148 --> 00:47:44,891
Head, feet, feet.

456
00:47:44,974 --> 00:47:48,020
Woooo, feet.
Wooo.

457
00:47:48,072 --> 00:47:50,763
Woooo.

458
00:47:50,815 --> 00:47:53,861
Anger will not
help you.

459
00:47:55,196 --> 00:47:56,656
Get it.

460
00:48:13,471 --> 00:48:14,514
Hah!

461
00:48:17,434 --> 00:48:19,938
No good.

462
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:26,071
Good.

463
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:28,783
Thank you.

464
00:48:32,746 --> 00:48:35,041
- A... an...
- Anger.

465
00:48:35,093 --> 00:48:37,545
- No.
- Okay.

466
00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:41,299
Feet.

467
00:48:58,114 --> 00:48:59,658
(cloth ripping)

468
00:49:14,177 --> 00:49:17,807
Are you all right?
I gave you a pretty good whack.

469
00:49:17,859 --> 00:49:19,476
Sorry.

470
00:49:21,563 --> 00:49:25,651
My name's Ya...
Nick.

471
00:49:25,703 --> 00:49:27,529
What's your name?

472
00:49:29,615 --> 00:49:31,993
Oh, damn it,
how do you say it?

473
00:49:32,118 --> 00:49:33,579
Nick.

474
00:49:35,748 --> 00:49:37,625
- Toma.
- Toma.

475
00:49:37,677 --> 00:49:39,503
Toma, that's nice.

476
00:49:52,771 --> 00:49:54,732
(baby crying)

477
00:50:02,368 --> 00:50:04,694
- Sir?
- Mmm.

478
00:50:04,746 --> 00:50:07,248
How come the women do
so much work around the camp?

479
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:12,526
- It is what they wish.
- Why?

480
00:50:12,578 --> 00:50:15,750
The women cut
and haul the wood,

481
00:50:15,802 --> 00:50:18,639
pack the meat,
take care of the children,

482
00:50:18,691 --> 00:50:21,272
tan the hides,
make the clothes,

483
00:50:21,324 --> 00:50:24,258
and they do
all the cooking.

484
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:27,192
Some of what you say
is true.

485
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:41,879
(speaking
in Native American)

486
00:50:43,047 --> 00:50:46,885
Our mother says the women
want it done correctly.

487
00:50:59,528 --> 00:51:01,196
- Boo!
- Prissy,

488
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,116
what the devil
are you doing out here?

489
00:51:03,168 --> 00:51:04,900
I could've caught you
with the axe.

490
00:51:04,952 --> 00:51:07,810
No, you can't see me
'cause I'm a ghost.

491
00:51:07,862 --> 00:51:10,308
And ghosts are spirits
without bodies.

492
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,753
- How do you know that?
- Sunday school.

493
00:51:14,339 --> 00:51:16,217
Hey, don't get too close.

494
00:51:16,301 --> 00:51:18,803
Nah, you can't hurt ghosts.

495
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,958
An arrowhead!
Sylvester, look!

496
00:51:25,010 --> 00:51:27,080
Maybe the Indians
took Nick,

497
00:51:27,132 --> 00:51:29,099
and they dropped it here.

498
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,654
Nah, I think
he just ran away.

499
00:51:31,706 --> 00:51:34,106
Do you think
he'll ever come home?

500
00:51:34,158 --> 00:51:37,370
- He might be dead.
- Shut up, Jake, just shut up!

501
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:41,334
And what are you doing out here?
You should be helping Ma.

502
00:51:41,386 --> 00:51:43,962
I turned into a ghost,
and floated out.

503
00:51:46,466 --> 00:51:48,844
Sylvester, look.

504
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,809
Sylvester:
First of the season.

505
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:55,728
Prissy: Yup.
First of the season.

506
00:51:57,105 --> 00:51:59,129
Winter's just around
the corner.

507
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:01,152
Yup. Just around
the corner.

508
00:52:01,204 --> 00:52:03,264
Priscilla?
Priscilla?

509
00:52:03,316 --> 00:52:05,273
Don't let her see me.

510
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:07,368
I thought no one
could see you.

511
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,413
Mothers can see
everything.

512
00:52:09,497 --> 00:52:13,043
- Prissy, I can see you there.
- I told you.

513
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:14,947
Come in this instant.

514
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:16,799
Or you'll wish you had.

515
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:21,179
Sure wish Nick was here.

516
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:34,447
(wagon approaching)

517
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:45,921
- Man: Where would you look?
- Everywhere.

518
00:52:45,973 --> 00:52:47,882
That's a lot
of territory to cover.

519
00:52:51,012 --> 00:52:53,463
Martha, your bread
is delicious.

520
00:52:53,515 --> 00:52:55,600
Let me pour you
some more Brigham tea.

521
00:52:58,021 --> 00:52:59,930
Man: How do you know
who took him?

522
00:52:59,982 --> 00:53:02,548
I think it was the Bannocks.
they're the only ones

523
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:05,463
- who come down this far.
- Why the Bannocks? Why not

524
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:08,326
the Gosiutes or the Utes
or the Crow or the Shoshone?

525
00:53:08,378 --> 00:53:09,786
they were the first ones
I thought of.

526
00:53:09,911 --> 00:53:12,623
- I have to start somewhere.
- And how do you know

527
00:53:12,675 --> 00:53:14,449
they're not going
to take you?

528
00:53:14,501 --> 00:53:17,714
Or worse, kill you?
Will that help your mother?

529
00:53:17,766 --> 00:53:21,260
Good heavens, boy,
you're a farmer.

530
00:53:21,312 --> 00:53:23,712
You'd be eaten alive
up there.

531
00:53:23,764 --> 00:53:27,936
If not by savages, then
by the bear or mountain lion,

532
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:30,214
- or by the elements.
- I gotta try.

533
00:53:30,266 --> 00:53:32,442
Don't you understand?
I gotta try.

534
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:34,820
Can't you wait until
your father comes back?

535
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,719
It'll be too late then.

536
00:53:36,771 --> 00:53:38,492
You think Nick's dead.

537
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:41,621
That's not what I'm saying.

538
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:44,416
Martha?

539
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,454
He's gotta try.

540
00:53:48,506 --> 00:53:53,386
I suppose if Brother Miller
takes your south field,

541
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,015
and Brother Cannon and I
take your north,

542
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,976
I suppose we could manage.

543
00:53:58,101 --> 00:54:00,188
You leave Benjamin,
and take my horse Buck.

544
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:03,891
- Yes, sir.
- On one condition.

545
00:54:03,943 --> 00:54:07,072
- You come back to your ma.
- Yes, sir.

546
00:54:38,656 --> 00:54:40,242
Oooh!

547
00:54:40,325 --> 00:54:42,745
You have ears.

548
00:54:42,797 --> 00:54:44,706
U s e.

549
00:54:49,212 --> 00:54:50,495
Nick: So what are you doing?

550
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:54,042
- Walking.
- That's what I was doing.

551
00:54:54,094 --> 00:54:56,388
I’ve e been practicing
with that bow you gave me.

552
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,057
- Good.
- I think I'm getting better.

553
00:54:58,109 --> 00:54:59,852
- Feet.
- I remember.

554
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:09,656
Morogonai, why'd you tell
everyone my name was Yagaichi?

555
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:11,826
That's causing me
some awful trouble.

556
00:55:11,878 --> 00:55:15,237
Good name, Yagaichi.

557
00:55:15,289 --> 00:55:18,501
To be a white man
family Washakie,

558
00:55:18,553 --> 00:55:20,718
you need to be strong.

559
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,883
This name, Yagaichi,

560
00:55:22,935 --> 00:55:26,168
is hard name.

561
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,307
Teach you be strong.

562
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:33,021
What are you
looking at?

563
00:55:33,104 --> 00:55:35,608
Bad days.

564
00:55:37,694 --> 00:55:39,311
What do you see?

565
00:55:39,363 --> 00:55:44,161
We hunt them.
Making war.

566
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,334
You can see
all that in the sky?

567
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:52,297
Sometimes the sky...

568
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:57,012
is open.

569
00:56:00,350 --> 00:56:02,520
When does the sky say
this will happen?

570
00:56:05,857 --> 00:56:08,225
hunt always this...

571
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:12,762
- what is word? Seas... s eas...
- Season?

572
00:56:12,814 --> 00:56:17,248
Morogonai: Season.
hunt always this season.

573
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,628
But is hard,
this time.

574
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,080
- No many buffalo.
- Why?

575
00:56:24,132 --> 00:56:27,553
these Indian people
living over there.

576
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:32,476
No keep their land.
No keep their home.

577
00:56:32,528 --> 00:56:35,970
Come here now.

578
00:56:36,022 --> 00:56:39,653
they're hungry.
Need to eat.

579
00:56:42,155 --> 00:56:44,367
Is it 'cause of the whites?

580
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:49,374
Many white people.

581
00:56:49,426 --> 00:56:51,826
Morogonai,

582
00:56:51,878 --> 00:56:53,337
do you hate the whites?

583
00:56:53,421 --> 00:56:55,924
No. Morogonai no hate.

584
00:56:55,976 --> 00:56:59,470
Hate make man...

585
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:03,852
I hated
my brother Sylvester.

586
00:57:03,904 --> 00:57:06,981
Is no good, Yagaichi.

587
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:11,153
Keep...
keep this,

588
00:57:11,205 --> 00:57:14,267
Yagaichi,
keep this.

589
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,329
This life no is long.

590
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:19,414
No hate.

591
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,753
No hate.

592
00:57:28,051 --> 00:57:31,097
- Morogonai?
- Mmm, Yagaichi.

593
00:57:31,149 --> 00:57:33,475
How do I find
my vision?

594
00:57:33,527 --> 00:57:36,187
Be still.

595
00:57:37,856 --> 00:57:39,942
Quiet.

596
00:57:40,068 --> 00:57:42,153
No words.

597
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:44,239
Listen.

598
00:57:45,992 --> 00:57:48,245
Your heart...

599
00:57:48,297 --> 00:57:50,586
vision...

600
00:57:50,638 --> 00:57:52,876
comes.

601
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,718
He tried to do
the right things,

602
00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:09,982
but his help was not
always wanted, or understood.

603
00:58:10,034 --> 00:58:12,820
(speaking Native American)

604
00:58:13,654 --> 00:58:16,678
Morogonai gave the boy
love, friendship,

605
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,703
and taught him
the way of the Shoshone.

606
00:58:19,756 --> 00:58:23,589
And the way
from boy to man.

607
00:58:23,641 --> 00:58:27,423
In battle,
you are no longer.

608
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:50,402
- Do again.
- I'm trying!

609
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:52,039
If you'd stop
throwing those rocks...

610
00:58:56,086 --> 00:58:58,923
Aaah! Ah!

611
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,560
Female voice:
# Far away #

612
00:59:07,685 --> 00:59:09,646
# You've learned #

613
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:12,932
# About the world #

614
00:59:12,984 --> 00:59:16,009
# And that we are all one #

615
00:59:16,061 --> 00:59:19,633
# Look to your spirit #

616
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:22,655
# To show you the way #

617
00:59:22,707 --> 00:59:25,669
# When dreamers dream #

618
00:59:25,721 --> 00:59:28,579
# The legend goes #

619
00:59:28,631 --> 00:59:30,716
# It's then you'll know #

620
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,802
# The wind calls #

621
00:59:32,854 --> 00:59:35,848
# Your name #

622
00:59:44,902 --> 00:59:47,822
# You will always
find a friend #

623
00:59:47,874 --> 00:59:50,326
# Just open up
your heart #

624
00:59:50,378 --> 00:59:52,277
# If you believe #

625
00:59:52,329 --> 00:59:55,875
# Then love will
raise you to new heights #

626
00:59:55,927 --> 00:59:59,030
# See how your love
runs deep #

627
00:59:59,082 --> 01:00:02,133
# Like the Rivers
of the wind #

628
01:00:02,185 --> 01:00:04,668
# Let it soar on wings #

629
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,140
# And bring you home again. #

630
01:00:59,711 --> 01:01:04,092
- (signaling)
- (speaking in Native American)

631
01:01:11,185 --> 01:01:12,312
Morogonai!

632
01:01:19,196 --> 01:01:21,824
Look, it's
the Indian from the road.

633
01:01:21,876 --> 01:01:23,076
Pocatello.

634
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:28,918
- Haata.
- Haata? Poisoned?

635
01:01:38,305 --> 01:01:41,935
- What did he say?
- He want you.

636
01:01:44,355 --> 01:01:49,987
White men trade maybe four,
five horses for you.

637
01:01:53,116 --> 01:01:55,703
Good price.

638
01:03:29,288 --> 01:03:31,196
Sylvester: " Dearest Mother,

639
01:03:31,248 --> 01:03:35,171
once again, I'm afraid there is
no good news to tell you.

640
01:03:35,223 --> 01:03:39,093
I have followed many leads,
but still have no sign of Nick.

641
01:03:39,145 --> 01:03:40,793
It is September now.

642
01:03:40,845 --> 01:03:42,879
I will soon
have to make a choice,

643
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:46,123
to come home,
or endure another winter.

644
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,205
I wish you could advise me
what to do.

645
01:03:49,257 --> 01:03:52,236
I will write again
as soon as I can.

646
01:03:52,288 --> 01:03:53,987
Send everybody my love,

647
01:03:54,113 --> 01:03:56,074
and tell them
not to worry about me.

648
01:03:56,126 --> 01:03:58,077
I'm doing fine.

649
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,246
Your loving son,
Sylvester."

650
01:04:00,298 --> 01:04:02,124
(yelling signal)

651
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:22,776
- H uh?
- (chuckling)

652
01:04:28,534 --> 01:04:30,495
White men.

653
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:46,976
(Morogonai chuckling)

654
01:04:47,028 --> 01:04:49,396
Ya ha.

655
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,287
Man: The Mormons
and the Indians

656
01:05:01,339 --> 01:05:02,695
have one spirit Father.

657
01:05:02,747 --> 01:05:05,459
And He is sad
that we fight.

658
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:07,702
We do not kill
white people.

659
01:05:07,754 --> 01:05:10,758
No, but some
of your brothers do.

660
01:05:13,386 --> 01:05:15,681
Some of yours do also.

661
01:05:15,733 --> 01:05:17,924
Yes.

662
01:05:17,976 --> 01:05:20,354
And our Father in heaven
is full of sorrow.

663
01:05:21,397 --> 01:05:23,849
The white man comes
in peace.

664
01:05:23,901 --> 01:05:27,447
Of course, there are
bad white men,

665
01:05:27,499 --> 01:05:30,159
just as there are
bad Indians.

666
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:31,984
But for the most part,

667
01:05:32,036 --> 01:05:34,122
these are poor,
honest folk,

668
01:05:34,174 --> 01:05:36,490
searching for a home.

669
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:38,774
Your friend Brigham
is concerned for you.

670
01:05:38,826 --> 01:05:41,007
He believes
it will not be many snows

671
01:05:41,132 --> 01:05:43,426
before the game
in your country is gone

672
01:05:43,511 --> 01:05:46,640
and there will be no food
for your families.

673
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,465
Would you change
the color of our skin?

674
01:05:48,517 --> 01:05:53,315
Man: No, but we do not desire
for your people to starve.

675
01:05:53,367 --> 01:05:55,402
We will bring
seed and tools,

676
01:05:55,527 --> 01:05:57,018
and teach you
what you must learn.

677
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:00,930
Send my thanks
to my new friend Big Ham,

678
01:06:00,982 --> 01:06:04,789
and tell him
we will council on his words.

679
01:06:12,299 --> 01:06:14,301
(footsteps)

680
01:06:23,272 --> 01:06:24,816
From brother Brigham.

681
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:34,537
Brother Brigham wanted
to know your words

682
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:36,290
about this gift.

683
01:06:37,249 --> 01:06:39,419
This is good.

684
01:06:43,591 --> 01:06:47,763
He wanted to know
how you felt about the gift.

685
01:06:47,815 --> 01:06:50,814
Whites have
words for everything.

686
01:06:50,866 --> 01:06:53,813
But they are just words
from here.

687
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:57,484
But this...

688
01:06:58,403 --> 01:07:00,197
cannot speak.

689
01:07:17,303 --> 01:07:21,059
Nick: Sir, am I ever going
to find out why I'm here?

690
01:07:21,111 --> 01:07:22,936
Washakie:
Soon, you will know.

691
01:07:23,979 --> 01:07:26,900
But I don't understand.
You don't teach me anything

692
01:07:26,952 --> 01:07:28,985
like medicine,
or war, or the like.

693
01:07:31,906 --> 01:07:33,815
N ever mind.

694
01:07:33,867 --> 01:07:35,870
Soon I will know.

695
01:07:43,463 --> 01:07:45,549
Washakie: For strength.

696
01:07:51,099 --> 01:07:53,268
You should see
my real mother.

697
01:07:53,394 --> 01:07:55,772
She's quite pretty.

698
01:07:56,815 --> 01:07:59,266
Anyway, I think she is.

699
01:07:59,318 --> 01:08:02,968
Nick: She's probably calling
everybody in from the field,

700
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:06,619
and hollering at Jake,
"Get Blackie outta the house."

701
01:08:06,672 --> 01:08:08,914
Jake has this ugly
old dog and he...

702
01:08:11,209 --> 01:08:13,160
What am I doing?

703
01:08:13,212 --> 01:08:15,172
You don't understand
a word I say.

704
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:18,636
Yagaichi.

705
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:30,058
Washakie: When the summer
moved into fall,

706
01:08:30,110 --> 01:08:33,656
we would go to our winter home
to escape the heavy snows.

707
01:08:36,368 --> 01:08:39,706
Yagaichi traveled with us
at a difficult time.

708
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:43,294
As the snow
came early that y ear,

709
01:08:43,346 --> 01:08:45,839
the hunting grounds
were scarce.

710
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:49,041
We were forced
even further south,

711
01:08:49,093 --> 01:08:52,640
to find the abundance
needed for our survival.

712
01:09:06,492 --> 01:09:08,109
What is it?

713
01:09:08,161 --> 01:09:11,832
Is what the sky
has told me.

714
01:09:13,585 --> 01:09:15,170
(signaling)

715
01:09:45,294 --> 01:09:46,702
So?

716
01:09:46,754 --> 01:09:48,632
Crows come.
Fight.

717
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:50,510
Isn't that good?

718
01:09:50,635 --> 01:09:53,587
I do not like fight.

719
01:09:53,639 --> 01:09:56,101
No good comes.
But Crows

720
01:09:56,153 --> 01:09:58,511
will take our horses,

721
01:09:58,563 --> 01:10:03,026
our women. We do not keep
our horses, women,

722
01:10:03,078 --> 01:10:04,644
we will die.

723
01:10:04,696 --> 01:10:07,324
We must go,
make battle.

724
01:11:02,899 --> 01:11:04,902
Nick: Morogonai,

725
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,992
I want you to have this,

726
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:13,455
for strength.

727
01:12:29,181 --> 01:12:31,143
(horse whinnying)

728
01:12:38,862 --> 01:12:40,864
(war cries)

729
01:13:06,398 --> 01:13:08,401
(gunshot)

730
01:13:20,793 --> 01:13:23,713
(horse whinnying)

731
01:16:03,303 --> 01:16:05,515
Morogonai!

732
01:16:06,558 --> 01:16:08,519
Morogonai!

733
01:16:10,731 --> 01:16:12,691
Morogonai.

734
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:27,837
Morogonai?

735
01:16:30,423 --> 01:16:32,509
Morogonai?

736
01:16:33,887 --> 01:16:35,764
Morogonai.

737
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:44,192
(groaning)

738
01:16:47,237 --> 01:16:49,480
I go now.

739
01:16:49,532 --> 01:16:52,119
- No, I don't want you to go.
- I need go.

740
01:16:56,834 --> 01:16:59,838
I need my father.

741
01:17:01,423 --> 01:17:03,301
Stay here, I'm gonna
go get some help.

742
01:17:03,384 --> 01:17:05,387
No, Yagaichi, no.

743
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:09,924
Yagaichi,

744
01:17:09,976 --> 01:17:12,980
make a goodbye me now.

745
01:17:16,736 --> 01:17:20,074
I am your friend,

746
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,915
always.

747
01:17:37,514 --> 01:17:39,684
Morogonai.

748
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:22,992
Identify yourself.

749
01:18:23,075 --> 01:18:26,308
Sylvester Wilson,
from Grantsville,

750
01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:29,490
- Utah territory.
- You wouldn't be kin

751
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:33,213
- to Elijah Wilson?
- Yes, sir. He's my father.

752
01:18:34,883 --> 01:18:37,386
All I ask is
to share your fire.

753
01:18:40,390 --> 01:18:42,758
please, come.

754
01:18:42,810 --> 01:18:44,896
You're more than welcome.

755
01:18:51,363 --> 01:18:53,908
Man: May we offer you
some fish?

756
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:56,453
they're small,
but they're tasty.

757
01:18:56,505 --> 01:18:58,456
Thank you, I'm fine.

758
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:02,577
It'd be a shame
to waste them.

759
01:19:02,629 --> 01:19:05,758
We've already eaten, we'll
leave them for the varmints.

760
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:10,639
Well, if they'd
just go to waste.

761
01:19:12,517 --> 01:19:16,063
Go ahead, do yourself up.

762
01:19:16,115 --> 01:19:18,306
Thank you.

763
01:19:18,358 --> 01:19:22,447
Thank you. To be honest,
I am still hungry.

764
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,693
So...

765
01:19:27,745 --> 01:19:29,748
tell us, brother Wilson,

766
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,074
you look like...

767
01:19:32,126 --> 01:19:35,172
you've been away from home
for quite a while.

768
01:19:35,224 --> 01:19:36,925
N ear on to 18 months.

769
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:40,680
I'm searching for my brother.

770
01:19:40,732 --> 01:19:42,213
Your brother?

771
01:19:42,265 --> 01:19:45,185
We think the Indians took him
about two years ago.

772
01:19:45,237 --> 01:19:47,512
Here,

773
01:19:47,564 --> 01:19:49,504
wash it down with this.

774
01:19:49,556 --> 01:19:51,392
Man #2: Which ones?

775
01:19:51,444 --> 01:19:54,574
Don't know.
Can't find a trace of him.

776
01:19:54,626 --> 01:19:56,743
Man #2:
Why would you continue?

777
01:19:58,829 --> 01:20:00,780
Be cause...

778
01:20:00,832 --> 01:20:04,743
I know he's out here.
I can feel it.

779
01:20:04,795 --> 01:20:07,591
So what does this brother
of yours look like?

780
01:20:07,643 --> 01:20:10,808
He'd be about 15 now.

781
01:20:10,860 --> 01:20:13,923
Maybe near my height,

782
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,883
light colored hair,
blue eyes.

783
01:20:15,935 --> 01:20:18,564
Man #2: Last fall we were up
in Wind River country,

784
01:20:18,616 --> 01:20:20,473
up at Washakie's camp.

785
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:23,862
We saw a young boy
that appeared to be white.

786
01:20:23,914 --> 01:20:27,200
He had light hair.
Didn't get a look at his eyes.

787
01:20:28,786 --> 01:20:31,811
We weren't convinced
he was white.

788
01:20:31,863 --> 01:20:34,784
He was wearing
tribal clothes.

789
01:20:34,836 --> 01:20:37,965
Didn't look like he was
any kind of a prisoner.

790
01:20:38,017 --> 01:20:39,091
Did you find out
his name?

791
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:41,386
No, didn't have
a chance to ask.

792
01:20:41,511 --> 01:20:42,429
Why didn't you?

793
01:20:44,015 --> 01:20:46,883
I'm sorry.

794
01:20:46,935 --> 01:20:50,690
It's just that l...
It's been so long.

795
01:20:50,742 --> 01:20:53,611
Where is
the Wind River country?

796
01:22:30,408 --> 01:22:31,535
Pocatello!

797
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:30,437
This was it,
wasn't it?

798
01:23:30,489 --> 01:23:33,702
You have good aim,
my brother.

799
01:23:33,754 --> 01:23:35,788
I was aiming for his head.

800
01:23:41,003 --> 01:23:43,715
Heard it in the wind,
Washakie.

801
01:23:43,767 --> 01:23:46,428
Morogonai could read
the sky.

802
01:23:47,595 --> 01:23:52,477
He knew what would happen to him
if he had to fight the Crows.

803
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:55,262
Morogonai is miss ed.

804
01:23:55,314 --> 01:23:58,589
He would be
proud of you today.

805
01:23:58,641 --> 01:24:01,865
You are a warrior now,
my brother.

806
01:24:21,391 --> 01:24:24,395
I had council
with the elders today.

807
01:24:25,438 --> 01:24:26,607
I know.

808
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:34,116
We are worried
about the posse.

809
01:24:34,168 --> 01:24:36,620
I understand.

810
01:24:39,832 --> 01:24:41,835
I know that I'm done here.

811
01:24:43,296 --> 01:24:45,883
I must go back to my family.

812
01:24:47,885 --> 01:24:49,846
I want to go back.

813
01:24:56,313 --> 01:24:58,608
Do you understand?

814
01:25:04,658 --> 01:25:07,161
The head understands,

815
01:25:08,412 --> 01:25:10,665
the heart...

816
01:25:10,717 --> 01:25:12,919
cannot speak.

817
01:25:38,870 --> 01:25:43,042
Follow the River, it will
lead you back to your people.

818
01:25:50,261 --> 01:25:52,848
I promise to return again
to see my Shoshone mother.

819
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:54,851
You will return.

820
01:26:55,974 --> 01:26:57,309
Yagaichi.

821
01:27:38,824 --> 01:27:41,014
# Many moons #

822
01:27:41,066 --> 01:27:43,204
# have pass ed #

823
01:27:45,082 --> 01:27:47,033
# Turn the page #

824
01:27:47,085 --> 01:27:50,005
# As you look out and see #

825
01:27:50,057 --> 01:27:52,926
# A world of adventure #

826
01:27:53,010 --> 01:27:56,347
# That you've yet to live #

827
01:27:56,472 --> 01:27:59,184
# When dreamers dream #

828
01:27:59,236 --> 01:28:01,505
# The legend goes #

829
01:28:01,557 --> 01:28:03,774
# The wind calls #

830
01:28:03,858 --> 01:28:06,361
# Your name. #

831
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:08,363
What is it, Spirit?

832
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:18,878
Let's go!

833
01:28:25,470 --> 01:28:27,869
(gunshot)

834
01:28:27,921 --> 01:28:30,268
(war cry)

835
01:29:28,555 --> 01:29:31,600
- Sylvester: I got you covered.
- Nick: And I have you covered.

836
01:29:31,652 --> 01:29:33,687
You speak English?

837
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:35,721
Who are you?

838
01:29:35,773 --> 01:29:37,754
I asked you first.

839
01:29:37,806 --> 01:29:39,736
No, you didn't.

840
01:29:39,788 --> 01:29:42,740
Nick?

841
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:48,290
Sylvester?

842
01:29:49,959 --> 01:29:51,919
Yeah.

843
01:30:11,112 --> 01:30:13,407
What the devil
are you doing up here?

844
01:30:13,459 --> 01:30:14,992
Looking for you.

845
01:30:16,745 --> 01:30:21,460
- You were looking for me?
- For two years.

846
01:30:34,060 --> 01:30:36,303
Can you forgive me?

847
01:30:36,355 --> 01:30:39,901
It's me that needs
to be forgiven.

848
01:30:41,362 --> 01:30:42,561
I guess we're even then.

849
01:30:42,613 --> 01:30:46,107
You know,
if we start riding now,

850
01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:48,871
we could get a couple hours
closer to home before suns et.

851
01:30:48,923 --> 01:30:51,114
Why you in such a hurry?

852
01:30:51,166 --> 01:30:55,965
You're just going to have
to herd sheep and fix fences.

853
01:30:56,017 --> 01:30:58,593
I think
I can handle that.

854
01:31:00,679 --> 01:31:02,014
We're going home.

855
01:31:18,829 --> 01:31:23,000
(children laughing)

856
01:31:59,175 --> 01:32:02,429
Welcome home,
my young brother.

857
01:32:11,065 --> 01:32:14,111
This is where our mother
wanted to be.

858
01:32:26,419 --> 01:32:29,006
I promised I'd come back.

859
01:32:34,013 --> 01:32:36,465
I'm just sorry...

860
01:32:36,517 --> 01:32:39,229
I'm just sorry it wasn't...

861
01:32:39,281 --> 01:32:41,941
while you were still alive.

862
01:33:03,010 --> 01:33:04,888
(Nick sobbing)

863
01:33:05,013 --> 01:33:07,809
You are still Yagaichi.

864
01:33:09,812 --> 01:33:11,845
Washakie: In 1857,

865
01:33:11,897 --> 01:33:14,349
Yagaichi returned home.

866
01:33:14,401 --> 01:33:16,988
He mended fences,
and plowed fields.

867
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,564
In 1861,

868
01:33:19,616 --> 01:33:22,537
Nick Wilson went on to be come
one of the founders

869
01:33:22,589 --> 01:33:25,666
and original riders
of the Pony Express.

870
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:13,647
# Embrace the same earth #

871
01:34:13,699 --> 01:34:16,844
# And their spirits #

872
01:34:16,896 --> 01:34:19,989
# Will never die #

873
01:34:29,168 --> 01:34:31,984
# Cherish #

874
01:34:32,036 --> 01:34:34,749
# The moment #

875
01:34:34,801 --> 01:34:41,602

# The ancients #

878
01:34:47,443 --> 01:34:53,576
# To the mountain
we must climb #

879
01:34:53,628 --> 01:34:59,699

# Embrace the same earth #

883
01:35:15,115 --> 01:35:18,009
# And the River #

884
01:35:18,061 --> 01:35:20,904
# Will never dry #

885
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:33,286
# Listen #

886
01:35:33,338 --> 01:35:36,624

# See it in the sky #

888
01:35:42,569 --> 01:35:45,469
# Feel it #

889
01:35:45,521 --> 01:35:48,504

890
01:35:48,556 --> 01:35:51,487
# There are answers #

# All around #

892
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:22,602
# Enter #

893
01:36:22,654 --> 01:36:25,220
# The circle #

894
01:36:25,272 --> 01:36:27,735
# You will see #

895
01:36:27,787 --> 01:36:32,250
# Through our father's eyes #

896
01:36:32,302 --> 01:36:34,618
