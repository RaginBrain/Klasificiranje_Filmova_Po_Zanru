2
00:00:45,842 --> 00:00:51,524
The Cuckoo

3
00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:23,199
Get changed.

4
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,960
It's ready.

5
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:04,440
Go over there.

6
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:20,399
Hold it.

7
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,039
-Who chose this place?
-Me. Don't you like it?

8
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,119
It's lovely. Thanks.

9
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,160
-What's he saying?
-It's a good spot for a sniper.

10
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,000
-Should I leave the glasses here?
-Yes.

11
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:27,880
Sit here until we've gone over the hill.

12
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,398
-If you take the gun, he'll shoot you.
-I don't shoot in the back.

13
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,519
They all say that, but Iast week
Big Jussi got a bullet here.

14
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:44,678
Good luck, private. Goodbye.

15
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,519
Damn!

16
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:45,039
<i>Down by the hill, you see?</i>

17
00:10:45,239 --> 00:10:48,598
<i>I see. Then where?</i>

18
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:57,598
One turn to the left, 2nd to the right, 3rd
past the burned bridge, there's a ford....

19
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,278
I believe you're innocent. You're
a good man and an honest officer.

20
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,158
Stop babbling!

21
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:07,336
Comrade lieutenant,
for your journey!

22
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,303
Let's go!

23
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,707
Good luck, comrade lieutenant!

24
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:29,253
Careful!

25
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,723
Comrade lieutenant,
you can see the state of the road!

26
00:11:42,564 --> 00:11:45,400
Comrades, give us a push!

27
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:57,411
Mister!

28
00:11:57,744 --> 00:11:58,910
Mister!

29
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:03,548
I recognized you!
You worked at our shooting range.

30
00:12:03,715 --> 00:12:04,949
What shooting range?

31
00:12:05,116 --> 00:12:07,051
By the market.

32
00:12:07,219 --> 00:12:08,819
What market?

33
00:12:08,987 --> 00:12:11,221
In Bezhetsk. Near the market.

34
00:12:11,389 --> 00:12:12,623
No, it wasn't me.

35
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:16,693
You look like him, but you used
to have a moustache.

36
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:20,329
-Stop talking to the prisoner!
-Get lost!

37
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:29,036
Thanks, lads.

38
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:44,065
Much further?

39
00:15:45,068 --> 00:15:47,669
Much further, captain?

40
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:50,806
I don't know.
I never used this road.

41
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:58,746
Comrade junior lieutenant,
may I--?

42
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,591
Comrade junior lieutenant,
they're our fighter planes.

43
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,526
I can see that myseIf!

44
00:16:18,528 --> 00:16:21,196
Comrade junior lieutenant,
can I go to the toiIet?

45
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:23,164
Okay.

46
00:16:26,968 --> 00:16:30,505
Don't run off, though.
Be a shame to shoot you.

47
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:33,575
Comrade junior lieutenant,
have you got some paper?

48
00:16:33,741 --> 00:16:35,875
Only your diary, but that's evidence.

49
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:40,379
It's all about you and your friend...

50
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:44,284
...and your anti-Soviet plotting.

51
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:50,154
If I had my way,
you'd be shot without a trial....

52
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:21,798
I won't harm you. I'll just take
a littIe of your strength.

53
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:28,806
The sick one needs it.
Don't worry.

54
00:29:31,656 --> 00:29:33,091
Where am I?

55
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:38,230
This amuIet will heIp you fight
the weakness in your body.

56
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:47,104
I have to....

57
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:49,571
Don't be shy.

58
00:29:55,143 --> 00:29:57,244
Go on!

59
00:30:06,787 --> 00:30:10,290
You'll get better. Sleep.

60
00:34:43,151 --> 00:34:46,487
So, what are you going to
do now, lieutenant?

61
00:34:48,456 --> 00:34:51,125
I'll piss on your grave yet!

62
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:47,621
Hello. I have to get the chain off.

63
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,924
I need a blacksmith.

64
00:36:53,626 --> 00:36:57,430
Do you speak Finnish?
I want to get this off!

65
00:36:57,596 --> 00:36:59,566
Do you understand?

66
00:37:02,134 --> 00:37:07,238
You want the iron off?
You were a prisoner?

67
00:37:07,405 --> 00:37:13,143
I don't understand you. Do you
speak Finnish? You're a Lapp?

68
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:16,812
I need a blacksmith. Is there a man?

69
00:37:16,979 --> 00:37:20,216
I need to get the chain off!

70
00:37:20,382 --> 00:37:23,619
I can't walk like this!

71
00:37:24,787 --> 00:37:29,457
You shout a lot.
Shouting never broke an iron.

72
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:34,228
I'll have a look,
my husband had some tooIs.

73
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:37,998
Anything you say, madam.

74
00:38:09,491 --> 00:38:11,726
Your husband?

75
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:14,895
Sick?

76
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,166
Is he your husband?

77
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:22,100
Are you wounded or sick?

78
00:38:22,734 --> 00:38:25,403
Fritz. SS....

79
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,139
Russian.

80
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:38,248
I'm not German. You think
I'm from the north division?

81
00:38:38,415 --> 00:38:43,486
They make us wear a uniform
so we won't surrender.

82
00:38:43,652 --> 00:38:48,722
Because you don't like Germans,
especially in uniform.

83
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:51,258
<i>{y:i}Sprechen Sie Deutsch?</i>

84
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:54,127
<i>{y:i}Hände hoch! Hitler kaputt!</i>

85
00:38:58,431 --> 00:39:02,100
It'll be hard if that's
all the German you know.

86
00:39:03,436 --> 00:39:07,606
Don't worry,
the war's over for me.

87
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:13,310
I'll get the chain off and go home.

88
00:39:14,177 --> 00:39:18,181
Do you understand?

89
00:39:21,017 --> 00:39:24,019
A cuckoo, a condemned sniper,
for crying out loud.

90
00:39:24,186 --> 00:39:25,820
Are you wounded?

91
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:30,325
You were probably in that car.

92
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:32,993
In the auto.

93
00:39:33,193 --> 00:39:34,528
Airplane.

94
00:39:36,696 --> 00:39:40,200
I couldn't understand why
the Russian planes fired at you.

95
00:39:43,703 --> 00:39:49,141
Shoot, you scum. My own people
will put me up against a wall, anyway.

96
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:53,777
I'm Veikko. And you? Ivan?

97
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:55,445
Get lost!

98
00:39:55,613 --> 00:39:57,848
Gerlost!

99
00:39:58,014 --> 00:40:01,584
Veikko, Gerlost.... And you?

100
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,154
Anni. I just told you my reaI name!

101
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:09,524
You can put the eye on me now.

102
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:12,526
Anni, Gerlost, Veikko.

103
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:14,095
A pleasure to meet you.

104
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:18,732
It's a shame we haven't got
anything to ceIebrate with.

105
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:24,669
Don't worry about me bIabbering.
It's the nerves.

106
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:29,808
A condemned man that survived,
that means a lot.

107
00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:33,077
I see.

108
00:40:46,288 --> 00:40:49,391
I don't think they're pleased to see me.

109
00:40:49,558 --> 00:40:52,626
I'm sorry I've disturbed your peace.

110
00:40:52,793 --> 00:40:56,263
I'll take the chain off and go.

111
00:40:57,331 --> 00:41:01,333
Come on.
I'll give you the tooIs.

112
00:41:28,957 --> 00:41:31,326
These are my husband's tooIs.

113
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:40,766
Your husband makes Lapland knives?

114
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,438
You're a sharp Iad.

115
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:52,777
Probably had to fight the girIs off.

116
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:57,781
Or did you have a few?

117
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:03,118
I'll take the chain off and go.

118
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:15,329
It's my fourth year without a man.

119
00:42:15,496 --> 00:42:19,732
Last night I hugged the Russian.
He sIept...

120
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,535
...but I was aching below the tummy.

121
00:42:29,807 --> 00:42:32,076
You smell bad.

122
00:42:32,243 --> 00:42:36,981
All men smell of iron and death now.

123
00:42:37,147 --> 00:42:38,682
Yes, lots of midges.

124
00:42:38,849 --> 00:42:41,684
When I was chained on the rock...

125
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,186
...I thought they'd eat me away.

126
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:48,089
Fortunately the wind bIew them off.

127
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:53,395
Have you got a sauna?
Can I have a wash?

128
00:42:53,561 --> 00:42:56,964
Your skin's white,
whiter than any woman I've seen.

129
00:42:57,130 --> 00:43:04,270
The midges bit you because
you wash too often.

130
00:43:06,939 --> 00:43:10,709
Four years without a man,
and then two at once.

131
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:13,577
Have the spirits read my thoughts?

132
00:43:21,751 --> 00:43:28,090
He's got my skirt on!
Why are you dressed like a woman?!

133
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:43,569
Grinning, Fritz? Won't be
grinning for much longer!

134
00:43:57,248 --> 00:43:59,483
A good knife, but the handIe's short.

135
00:44:00,483 --> 00:44:03,453
Gerlost, I told you,
the war's over for me.

136
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,524
I don't want to kill, but I don't
want to be killed. Understand?

137
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:11,593
Go on, finish me off.

138
00:44:11,759 --> 00:44:16,062
That's my husband's knife.
It's mine when he's not here.

139
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:27,572
Don't go killing each other!
I don't plan to bury you both.

140
00:44:28,573 --> 00:44:30,809
What are you waiting for?

141
00:44:31,776 --> 00:44:37,414
Think I'll kill you? My war is over,
my friend! Understand?

142
00:44:37,748 --> 00:44:40,316
Understand? My war is over.

143
00:44:41,317 --> 00:44:43,819
Leo ToIstoy, "War and Peace."

144
00:44:45,788 --> 00:44:49,023
Shoot, scum.

145
00:44:49,191 --> 00:44:54,762
Leo ToIstoy, "War and Peace."
Understand?

146
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:59,833
I understand you're a fascist.
You burnt Yasnaya Polyana.

147
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,504
I'm not a fascist. I'm a Finn.

148
00:45:05,672 --> 00:45:11,477
I was at university, then the war.
I didn't want to fight.

149
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:16,447
You idiot! Fyodor Dostoyevsky.

150
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:20,550
Fyodor Dostoyevsky. You idiot!

151
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:23,452
I can't understand a word....

152
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:26,656
I'm tired of fighting!

153
00:45:27,823 --> 00:45:34,462
Ernest Hemingway,
"A Farewell to Arms"!

154
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:39,499
I don't know Russian.

155
00:45:40,868 --> 00:45:44,637
I should have studied it.
Sorry, Gerlost.

156
00:45:47,272 --> 00:45:49,608
It's abominabIe and miserabIe here.

157
00:45:52,877 --> 00:45:55,280
It's beautiful here.

158
00:45:55,579 --> 00:45:57,381
It was only yesterday...

159
00:45:57,548 --> 00:46:03,019
...when I was a condemned man,
chained to a rock like Prometheus.

160
00:46:03,186 --> 00:46:06,055
Just when I figured out
about Prometheus...

161
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:10,860
...I thought about it further
and saw how to get the chain off.

162
00:46:11,392 --> 00:46:16,264
I could have used other means
instead of the glasses.

163
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:21,834
They weren't as practicaI. I could've
taken the bullet out of the shell...

164
00:46:23,502 --> 00:46:29,174
...and shot in the grass.
It would have probably caught fire.

165
00:46:32,477 --> 00:46:37,215
I hope people will look back
in horror at what they did at war.

166
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:42,753
The main thing is, we're alive.
You and me.

167
00:46:43,753 --> 00:46:47,590
Maybe they won't even
think about the whole thing.

168
00:46:50,526 --> 00:46:54,429
Man is capabIe of
doing strange things.

169
00:46:54,595 --> 00:46:57,064
Dostoyevsky said that.

170
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:04,671
You can make a lot
of good things with it.

171
00:47:08,573 --> 00:47:10,276
He's cheered up, the fascist.

172
00:47:10,976 --> 00:47:13,778
I never shared the views
of the fascists. I'm a democrat.

173
00:47:15,046 --> 00:47:18,949
-Fascist, all the same.
-Democracy!

174
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:25,555
Come and eat.

175
00:47:25,722 --> 00:47:28,691
Let's go and eat.

176
00:47:37,165 --> 00:47:44,504
Worried I'll thump you? I would,
if it weren't for the concussion.

177
00:47:45,505 --> 00:47:50,842
It's my second.
First was in the winter of '42.

178
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:04,453
Can I have some more?

179
00:48:07,122 --> 00:48:13,228
You eat a lot. To eat a lot,
you have to work a lot.

180
00:48:13,394 --> 00:48:15,029
Thank you.

181
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:32,645
Thank you,
everything was very tasty.

182
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,916
Usually I don't drink coffee,
but thanks for that.

183
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:54,495
Stupid woman.

184
00:49:13,478 --> 00:49:15,746
Got a smoke?

185
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:17,549
Got a snout?

186
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:21,818
<i>{y:i}Bitte, eine Zigarette.</i>

187
00:49:21,985 --> 00:49:25,788
If I had one, I'd smoke it myseIf.

188
00:49:27,623 --> 00:49:29,958
Thanks, fascist.

189
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:44,070
Take it off, I'll wash it.

190
00:49:46,138 --> 00:49:52,378
Take that off as well.

191
00:49:55,146 --> 00:49:59,417
You just love wrapping
yourseIf up in clothes.

192
00:50:12,328 --> 00:50:16,664
You're not bad.
GirIs like your kind.

193
00:50:17,832 --> 00:50:19,601
Listen, Fritz!

194
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,237
She seems to like you.

195
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:29,442
What are you in a dress for?
Take it off. You look silly.

196
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,343
Get lost!

197
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:39,417
Gerlost, you're shy.
The Lapps don't understand that.

198
00:50:39,583 --> 00:50:43,052
They live a simple life.

199
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:48,557
You talk a lot. My ears are ringing from
all those words. I don't understand it.

200
00:50:48,724 --> 00:50:53,863
She hasn't got much fish ready.
The winter will be hard.

201
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:59,267
We're just extra mouths to feed.
We have to go quickly.

202
00:51:14,479 --> 00:51:16,615
My eyesight's fine.

203
00:51:16,781 --> 00:51:20,884
I started wearing glasses
to look more serious at university.

204
00:51:21,352 --> 00:51:25,388
My family had difficuIty
getting money for my studies.

205
00:51:25,556 --> 00:51:29,025
In StockhoIm they
look down on Finns...

206
00:51:29,191 --> 00:51:31,827
...so I started wearing glasses.

207
00:51:33,295 --> 00:51:36,030
I never thought they'd save me.

208
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,161
She hasn't got much hay ready.

209
00:52:12,327 --> 00:52:16,832
Maybe just enough for the deer. They
can eat moss even under the snow.

210
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:20,868
They should be
taken to their winter pastures.

211
00:52:21,135 --> 00:52:23,637
Yes, be off, chatterbox!

212
00:52:26,807 --> 00:52:28,574
Let me heIp!

213
00:52:28,742 --> 00:52:35,046
Don't come near me
or I'll get wet and want to shout!

214
00:52:40,818 --> 00:52:44,722
She's angry.
The girI's smitten.

215
00:52:45,322 --> 00:52:46,790
What?

216
00:52:47,156 --> 00:52:49,258
I said, she's smitten.

217
00:53:00,435 --> 00:53:02,636
I'm making a chimney for the sauna.

218
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:05,372
I'm covering this with cIay.

219
00:53:05,505 --> 00:53:11,577
I'll throw it in the fire. The wood
will burn out and leave the chimney.

220
00:53:12,445 --> 00:53:13,913
A chimney.

221
00:53:35,764 --> 00:53:40,968
We'll boiI or fry them,
then eat them.

222
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:44,037
You want to go
to the other world?

223
00:53:44,205 --> 00:53:50,443
Drink the broth of toadstooIs.
Those will just make you sick.

224
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:53,979
Can't be bothered?
Don't. It's easy.

225
00:53:54,146 --> 00:53:58,716
Don't worry!
I'll cook them.

226
00:53:58,883 --> 00:54:03,053
The sergeant in my battalion
cooked them wonderfully!

227
00:54:14,763 --> 00:54:21,102
Gerlost's eating mushrooms
to commune with the spirits.

228
00:54:21,269 --> 00:54:25,171
Maybe he's a shaman or a wizard?

229
00:54:25,338 --> 00:54:29,075
Let him rest. He's still weak
after the concussion.

230
00:54:29,242 --> 00:54:32,044
I'll do it myseIf.

231
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,889
I think you're better at other things.

232
00:54:45,055 --> 00:54:48,458
I wouldn't mind if you threw me
down on a deerskin, Iad.

233
00:54:48,625 --> 00:54:53,029
I've aIready forgotten
what it's like.

234
00:54:53,196 --> 00:54:57,599
Don't kid around. I haven't
seen a woman in two months.

235
00:54:57,766 --> 00:55:02,103
Now even a hunchback
looks like a princess to me.

236
00:55:04,071 --> 00:55:09,342
You've got tender hands.
You're not used to men's work.

237
00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:13,246
You probably only know
how to kill.

238
00:55:13,413 --> 00:55:16,982
That's not work.

239
00:55:17,149 --> 00:55:19,750
It's just big children thinking
that taking a life...

240
00:55:20,584 --> 00:55:23,888
...Iengthens their own.

241
00:55:24,055 --> 00:55:26,824
Put the barreI back afterwards.

242
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:46,207
Ma'am, I need saIt.

243
00:55:46,373 --> 00:55:51,277
I'm not mad enough
to eat mushrooms!

244
00:55:51,444 --> 00:55:53,913
I see. In the house.

245
00:57:08,976 --> 00:57:11,643
Scum!

246
00:57:13,045 --> 00:57:16,416
The water brought a Ietter.

247
00:57:19,384 --> 00:57:24,455
The politicaI officer informed on me!
Snot-nosed kid!

248
00:57:24,621 --> 00:57:28,192
Hadn't served a week
at the front, and he informs!

249
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:30,260
I was like a father to the boy.

250
00:57:30,425 --> 00:57:35,731
He writes, ''I inform you that
I do not share the views....''

251
00:57:37,064 --> 00:57:41,335
The water washed out the words.
The water in the stream's good.

252
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:47,473
If you put Iaundry in it,
the next day it's cIean.

253
00:57:48,842 --> 00:57:53,113
Not much flour left. I added
some wood, and it's delicious.

254
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,515
He says my poems are rubbish!
Jealousy, maybe?

255
00:57:57,683 --> 00:58:01,251
Did he write anything in his life
except to inform on people?

256
00:58:01,419 --> 00:58:05,488
Sergei Yesenin himseIf
told me to write.

257
00:58:05,656 --> 00:58:10,058
My dad was a taxi driver.

258
00:58:10,227 --> 00:58:13,663
He was driving Yesenin one day
from the train station to the hoteI.

259
00:58:13,828 --> 00:58:17,131
I was a boy. I was sitting on the front
seat reading out my poems.

260
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:25,273
He said, ''You need to write.''
He even signed his photograph.

261
00:58:26,174 --> 00:58:30,244
Your wife? She's beautiful.

262
00:58:30,411 --> 00:58:35,381
The soldier men took
my husband four years ago.

263
00:58:36,448 --> 00:58:41,119
See, it's Yesenin himseIf!

264
00:58:42,387 --> 00:58:46,491
I wrote poems about the beauty
of nature, to stay sane at the front.

265
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:50,960
God knows what he saw in them.

266
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:57,032
Don't worry, you're still alive,
and your wife's very beautiful.

267
00:58:57,198 --> 00:59:02,937
Just don't eat mushrooms,
or you'll go loony.

268
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:09,376
The mushrooms will be ready soon.
We can eat. But we need some saIt.

269
00:59:09,543 --> 00:59:14,447
Yes. Mushrooms are bad.
They can be poisonous.

270
00:59:14,614 --> 00:59:18,584
Here I am chatting away.
Words won't feed the deer!

271
00:59:25,189 --> 00:59:27,124
You've ruined the iron.

272
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:32,429
I brought that barreI
from over the hill!

273
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:40,635
It's a bit rough, but we can wash.
It's aIready hot.

274
00:59:40,803 --> 00:59:43,605
Gerlost, come and wash!

275
00:59:44,605 --> 00:59:49,375
You get sick because you
scratch your skin off.

276
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:53,445
My husband washed
in a sauna in the city.

277
00:59:53,613 --> 00:59:57,916
I barely cured him, and he
never got sick before that.

278
01:00:00,853 --> 01:00:03,120
Even taking your rifIe
to the sauna?

279
01:00:03,288 --> 01:00:05,088
Get in.

280
01:00:20,736 --> 01:00:27,509
Not bad, aIthough the draft
takes the heat out fast.

281
01:00:27,673 --> 01:00:32,446
I don't like saunas.
I like Turkish baths.

282
01:00:32,611 --> 01:00:34,413
You understand?

283
01:00:35,247 --> 01:00:41,385
Oh, come on,
she's not bad as a woman.

284
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:46,789
Her kind is good at housework,
and they keep you awake in bed.

285
01:00:46,957 --> 01:00:50,928
We had a supervisor just like her.

286
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:52,661
I invited her to the cinema once...

287
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:57,200
...but she didn't come.

288
01:00:57,366 --> 01:01:03,338
Then she got married to a friend from
work, Viktor Bychkov was his name.

289
01:01:03,503 --> 01:01:08,175
Don't know what she saw in him,
he was ugly as sin, to be honest.

290
01:01:10,209 --> 01:01:11,945
I don't understand, Gerlost.

291
01:01:13,013 --> 01:01:15,314
Don't you like the sauna?

292
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:19,952
I'm no specialist.
I've only read how to do it.

293
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:23,187
I haven't been lucky with women.

294
01:01:23,355 --> 01:01:25,390
Married twice.

295
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:28,157
Both times it was a mess.

296
01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:44,272
What are you so serious about?

297
01:01:44,438 --> 01:01:47,408
Wash, because you smell
of war and death.

298
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:19,769
A crow fIew over the field.
It saw a herd of deer.

299
01:02:19,935 --> 01:02:23,505
It began to count, one, two, three....
Counted until daybreak.

300
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:26,906
Then it tired and crowed out,
''You're so many, and I'm but one!''

301
01:02:27,075 --> 01:02:32,879
It crowed and went to sleep.

302
01:02:35,449 --> 01:02:37,150
Let's go.

303
01:02:40,586 --> 01:02:42,420
Let's go. Don't worry.

304
01:02:42,588 --> 01:02:45,255
Though I do cry out when I like it.

305
01:02:51,661 --> 01:02:53,161
Damn!

306
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:54,848
Don't!

307
01:06:00,787 --> 01:06:04,723
Sorry, it was a bad dream.

308
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:08,627
I didn't mean to scare you.

309
01:06:08,792 --> 01:06:10,695
Feeling bad?

310
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:15,098
It's because you ate mushrooms.

311
01:06:15,266 --> 01:06:18,935
I'll make an infusion for you.
It will drive the badness out.

312
01:06:20,303 --> 01:06:23,606
I liked you straightaway.

313
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:27,507
But you chose a fascist.
He's younger, but he's still a fascist.

314
01:06:27,675 --> 01:06:32,246
I'll make an infusion from herbs.
You'll feeI better.

315
01:06:32,413 --> 01:06:37,516
I must work, or I'll be like
a fox in winter, eating turds.

316
01:06:38,685 --> 01:06:43,788
So you enjoyed it with him.
I heard you moaning under him.

317
01:06:43,956 --> 01:06:48,727
It really hurt me to hear that.
I wanted to kill both of you.

318
01:06:48,893 --> 01:06:53,263
Forgive me for those thoughts.
You brought me back to life.

319
01:06:54,331 --> 01:06:59,002
Rest. I've got a lot of work to do.

320
01:07:04,940 --> 01:07:07,776
You took my heart straightaway.

321
01:08:06,757 --> 01:08:09,360
I told you, Gerlost...

322
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,630
...there are no bullets.

323
01:08:13,062 --> 01:08:17,000
Are you jealous
because she chose me?

324
01:08:17,166 --> 01:08:18,769
Don't be.

325
01:08:18,935 --> 01:08:21,937
She just wanted a littIe happiness.

326
01:08:44,123 --> 01:08:47,224
To hell with you! Live.

327
01:08:47,393 --> 01:08:52,296
You're still young.
You haven't lived at all yet.

328
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:54,098
And I'm tired.

329
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,432
I'm tired of fighting.

330
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,770
My souI's been emptied by the war.

331
01:09:04,207 --> 01:09:05,606
I'll go and cut some wood!

332
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:11,411
I should go.

333
01:09:14,248 --> 01:09:19,520
It's an herb infusion.
Drink, Gerlost.

334
01:09:19,686 --> 01:09:22,088
What do you see in that fascist?

335
01:09:22,253 --> 01:09:25,324
He talks a lot, and you
can't understand a word.

336
01:09:29,227 --> 01:09:33,630
The mushroom poison
will leave your body...

337
01:09:33,798 --> 01:09:37,733
...and you'll feeI better.

338
01:09:42,205 --> 01:09:44,540
Tastes nice.

339
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:24,640
Eat, I want to cry out at night again.

340
01:10:26,608 --> 01:10:32,613
Don't give me that look,
or I'll be tearing my skirts off!

341
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:42,287
Oh, wow.

342
01:10:43,154 --> 01:10:45,324
Did you drink the infusion?

343
01:10:47,226 --> 01:10:48,394
Go over there!

344
01:10:48,559 --> 01:10:50,795
Go away!

345
01:10:50,962 --> 01:10:55,399
You poisoned me!
Go away, this isn't the theater!

346
01:10:55,566 --> 01:11:01,437
There's a pit over there!
Didn't you see where I went?

347
01:11:01,705 --> 01:11:05,807
Go away!
What are you looking at?

348
01:11:05,975 --> 01:11:10,879
You're a wild man, Gerlost.
The infusion worked.

349
01:11:11,046 --> 01:11:13,782
Not used to that many mushrooms.

350
01:11:13,948 --> 01:11:18,919
This is interesting?!
What are you embarrassing me for?

351
01:11:19,986 --> 01:11:23,523
Bring everyone to watch!

352
01:11:23,689 --> 01:11:27,126
Bring the dogs and the deer!
Let them all see. Madness!

353
01:11:32,964 --> 01:11:35,466
We have to fix the barn.

354
01:11:36,467 --> 01:11:41,405
You're both big.
I have to feed you with meat.

355
01:11:41,570 --> 01:11:44,506
Much better, thanks.

356
01:11:44,674 --> 01:11:46,309
Well....

357
01:11:47,041 --> 01:11:49,042
Thank you. I'll be off now.

358
01:11:49,211 --> 01:11:52,581
You're big and eat a lot...

359
01:11:52,747 --> 01:11:57,349
...but I can't kill a deer.
There are too few as it is.

360
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:59,018
Goodbye.

361
01:12:01,722 --> 01:12:06,692
Thanks for the bread and saIt,
aIthough you've got no saIt.

362
01:12:06,859 --> 01:12:11,961
You have good eyes, Gerlost.
But don't eat those mushrooms.

363
01:12:14,766 --> 01:12:17,433
It's good that we say goodbye.

364
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:20,036
I'll go.
I can't take it anymore.

365
01:12:20,204 --> 01:12:23,205
It's good here, but I'm going mad.

366
01:12:23,705 --> 01:12:25,674
I must be out of touch with life.

367
01:12:31,145 --> 01:12:33,148
Did he go
to get mushrooms again?

368
01:12:33,314 --> 01:12:35,617
Let me heIp.
Where should I take them?

369
01:12:36,215 --> 01:12:38,119
-Where are you taking them?
-There.

370
01:12:38,284 --> 01:12:41,855
I just brought them!

371
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:13,582
Thank you.

372
01:13:23,089 --> 01:13:26,190
You really are ugly.

373
01:14:06,059 --> 01:14:09,061
Germans! Hide!

374
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,331
Fascists!

375
01:14:12,496 --> 01:14:16,834
Only three of them. One is injured and
there is a woman, must be the nurse.

376
01:14:17,001 --> 01:14:20,904
Give me the gun. One's an officer. We'll
take him prisoner and get the credit!

377
01:14:21,071 --> 01:14:23,305
There are no bullets.

378
01:14:23,473 --> 01:14:25,807
What?! I am telling you,
Germans, fascists.

379
01:14:25,975 --> 01:14:29,711
I'm not fighting,
and there's nothing to fight with.

380
01:14:29,879 --> 01:14:34,016
They'll come over the hill,
and we'll be stuck out in the open.

381
01:14:36,084 --> 01:14:38,351
Give me the gun!

382
01:14:38,519 --> 01:14:41,420
Well, I'll take it by force then.

383
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:49,528
If it wasn't for the concussion,
I'd take you out!

384
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:54,765
I took people like you like that!

385
01:14:54,933 --> 01:14:58,169
-The war's over for me.
-Let me go! I am in pain!

386
01:14:58,334 --> 01:15:00,738
Do you understand? Over!

387
01:15:01,572 --> 01:15:03,974
I want to live a different life. Study....

388
01:15:07,877 --> 01:15:10,612
GeneraIs, lieutenants....
I'm a man like you!

389
01:15:10,779 --> 01:15:13,315
I want to live, not to fight!

390
01:15:15,048 --> 01:15:16,651
Why are you screaming?

391
01:15:17,819 --> 01:15:21,055
I thought you were a cuckoo,
a condemned sniper...

392
01:15:23,557 --> 01:15:25,890
...but you're just a coward.

393
01:15:26,059 --> 01:15:28,927
You were crafty,
throwing me in the fire.

394
01:15:29,095 --> 01:15:32,331
Up all night with a bird...

395
01:15:32,498 --> 01:15:35,434
...but still got some strength left!

396
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:45,375
Try to behave at Ieast in front of her.

397
01:15:46,374 --> 01:15:48,876
Your face is all dirty too.

398
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:53,915
Looks like you understood nothing.

399
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:59,319
I told you that my war is over!
Do you understand? Over!

400
01:16:01,655 --> 01:16:06,859
If you want to fight
and kill your own kind, go on!

401
01:16:07,726 --> 01:16:12,162
The world's not perfect,
but life's no worse for that.

402
01:16:12,330 --> 01:16:14,900
Perhaps you've
never lived, Gerlost?

403
01:16:15,065 --> 01:16:18,203
AIways fighting, and you
don't know anything eIse?

404
01:16:19,403 --> 01:16:21,404
Seems like a man's Iast moments...

405
01:16:21,572 --> 01:16:24,373
...muItiply his capability to see beauty.

406
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:28,277
I'd like to write poems, music...

407
01:16:28,442 --> 01:16:30,813
...even though I don't know how.

408
01:16:32,147 --> 01:16:34,183
I'm off, Gerlost.

409
01:16:35,115 --> 01:16:39,353
You haven't understood me,
and I haven't understood you.

410
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:45,292
More strength than you
know what to do with?

411
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:49,028
Then come heIp me.

412
01:16:49,462 --> 01:16:51,429
She wants heIp.

413
01:17:09,710 --> 01:17:11,113
Let's go.

414
01:19:40,337 --> 01:19:42,173
I've seen such machines.

415
01:19:42,338 --> 01:19:45,976
They never fIew here, though.

416
01:19:54,182 --> 01:19:56,116
What's happened?

417
01:19:56,285 --> 01:19:59,287
It didn't blow up.
Must have run out of fueI.

418
01:19:59,754 --> 01:20:01,855
Something white was around it.

419
01:20:02,022 --> 01:20:03,991
I'm going there. Come with me.

420
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,528
Stay here.

421
01:20:14,666 --> 01:20:18,668
The infusion heIped Gerlost.
He's marching along happily now.

422
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:45,392
Here, read it. Probably asking you
to give yourseIf up.

423
01:20:48,693 --> 01:20:49,895
Gerlost!

424
01:20:50,062 --> 01:20:52,198
FinIand's out of the war!

425
01:20:52,632 --> 01:20:55,267
We're not
fighting each other anymore!

426
01:20:55,534 --> 01:20:59,502
The war's over!
Hello, common sense!

427
01:21:19,653 --> 01:21:22,756
There's a dead pilot here.

428
01:21:42,038 --> 01:21:47,042
Women shouldn't fight.
It's unnatural and painful to see.

429
01:21:48,044 --> 01:21:54,649
Gerlost, I'm not a soldier
and not the enemy.

430
01:21:54,817 --> 01:21:59,788
It says here that the Finns
aren't fighting anymore.

431
01:22:00,787 --> 01:22:05,492
Happy that your people
shot a plane down?

432
01:22:11,097 --> 01:22:14,598
Happy? Hero.

433
01:22:14,767 --> 01:22:17,034
Against these kids,
you're the big hero.

434
01:22:17,202 --> 01:22:22,307
They were dropping IeafIets.
We should bury them.

435
01:22:22,472 --> 01:22:26,443
This is your people's work.
And yours, Fritz!

436
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:29,346
I'm a Finn!

437
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:31,915
How can I tell you
that I'm not fighting?

438
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:35,416
The war's over!

439
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:38,621
Look, Gerlost! I'm going
to break this cursed rifIe!

440
01:22:48,261 --> 01:22:50,730
You idiot, Gerlost.

441
01:22:50,895 --> 01:22:55,833
FinIand's signed a truce with Russia.

442
01:22:58,137 --> 01:23:02,374
''This serves as a pass home.''

443
01:23:02,874 --> 01:23:05,142
FinIand's surrendered?

444
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:09,177
Yes, if it heIps you understand...

445
01:23:09,345 --> 01:23:13,916
...that I don't fight anymore.
I surrendered a long time ago.

446
01:23:14,083 --> 01:23:16,986
Come on, Iad. Don't die.

447
01:23:17,151 --> 01:23:21,623
Hold on!
I'll carry you back in a fIash.

448
01:23:21,789 --> 01:23:23,691
Why can't you listen?

449
01:23:23,857 --> 01:23:26,660
Don't die!

450
01:24:00,887 --> 01:24:04,358
Don't be so quiet. Groan at Ieast.

451
01:24:04,525 --> 01:24:06,893
Let me know you're alive.

452
01:24:32,482 --> 01:24:34,750
Who wounded him?

453
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:36,152
I shot him by accident.

454
01:24:36,317 --> 01:24:39,319
I thought he wanted to hit me
with the gun.

455
01:24:39,488 --> 01:24:41,556
What happened?

456
01:24:41,723 --> 01:24:44,357
How stupid it was.
It'll be a shame if he dies.

457
01:24:44,525 --> 01:24:45,893
The Finns surrendered.

458
01:24:46,059 --> 01:24:49,029
Maybe the Germans gave in too
and the war's over.

459
01:24:52,866 --> 01:24:55,834
Go get some water!

460
01:24:57,668 --> 01:25:00,271
Go get some water!

461
01:25:06,109 --> 01:25:08,378
He's Ieaving us.

462
01:25:08,544 --> 01:25:12,281
I can't remember how to keep him
from the Iand of the dead.

463
01:25:16,451 --> 01:25:20,954
My granny knew how.

464
01:25:21,122 --> 01:25:23,056
She'd turn into a dog...

465
01:25:23,923 --> 01:25:27,428
...and bring him back with her bark.

466
01:29:52,683 --> 01:29:56,119
I'll turn my littIe finger
into the dying one.

467
01:29:56,285 --> 01:30:01,423
I'll hold his hand firm and turn you
from the path of death!

468
01:30:03,091 --> 01:30:06,027
I'll stop you on the road
to the Iand of the dead.

469
01:30:06,192 --> 01:30:08,328
Hear the dog howI...

470
01:30:08,496 --> 01:30:10,063
...and come back!

471
01:31:32,366 --> 01:31:38,705
I'll hold you firm and stop
you from Ieaving your body.

472
01:32:06,895 --> 01:32:11,666
Hear the dog howI!
It protects your hearth.

473
01:32:11,832 --> 01:32:14,902
It calls you back from the path
to the kingdom of the dead!

474
01:32:15,067 --> 01:32:17,536
Hear my howling.

475
01:32:17,703 --> 01:32:19,738
I'm catching up, jumping around you.

476
01:32:19,906 --> 01:32:24,109
I'm biting your hands and Iegs,
not Ietting you go on.

477
01:32:50,597 --> 01:32:52,564
Return to your body!

478
01:32:52,732 --> 01:32:55,100
Hear the cry of the dog!

479
01:33:30,930 --> 01:33:33,801
Turn off the road to the dead!

480
01:33:34,801 --> 01:33:38,738
I turn your souI into a floating log!

481
01:33:38,903 --> 01:33:43,208
You're carried by the waves,
I am the wind.

482
01:33:45,542 --> 01:33:50,047
I'm a strong northern wind
carrying you to the shore.

483
01:33:56,919 --> 01:34:02,825
Hear the dog howI on the shore.

484
01:34:02,992 --> 01:34:05,794
I drive you with my hot breath...

485
01:34:06,195 --> 01:34:09,864
...to your body lying on the shore.

486
01:34:10,031 --> 01:34:13,334
Run into your body! Run!

487
01:34:30,180 --> 01:34:31,749
Run into your body!

488
01:34:31,915 --> 01:34:33,384
Run!

489
01:34:33,549 --> 01:34:37,153
I blow your log body to the shore!

490
01:34:37,319 --> 01:34:39,155
I take you by the roots...

491
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:41,791
...and pull you out!

492
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:21,189
Spirit, return to the body!

493
01:35:44,809 --> 01:35:46,812
The spirit has returned.

494
01:35:52,517 --> 01:35:55,519
Gerlost, come here!

495
01:36:19,572 --> 01:36:21,041
He's alive.

496
01:36:24,176 --> 01:36:29,479
Come to me. I need warmth
and to feeI a man next to me.

497
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:32,516
Anni, you just rest.

498
01:36:32,782 --> 01:36:37,819
You were banging the drum
and shrieking all night.

499
01:36:38,422 --> 01:36:40,322
I'm not called Anni.

500
01:36:40,490 --> 01:36:46,126
My parents called me ''Cuckoo.''

501
01:36:46,295 --> 01:36:49,029
People called me ''Lame.''

502
01:36:49,197 --> 01:36:51,767
My husband called me ''Anni.''

503
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:54,568
But my reaI name's Cuckoo.

504
01:36:55,636 --> 01:36:59,005
Gerlost, come to me.

505
01:37:40,173 --> 01:37:45,244
Thanks, my dear, for everything.
For the bread and saIt.

506
01:37:45,410 --> 01:37:48,312
Don't be angry about anything.

507
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:51,282
You're a good woman.

508
01:37:52,516 --> 01:37:54,352
Thank you, Anni.

509
01:37:56,585 --> 01:37:58,354
What are you waiting for?

510
01:37:58,522 --> 01:38:03,159
I've got a lot to do.
Go. It's not my loss.

511
01:38:48,197 --> 01:38:50,332
This is it, Gerlost.

512
01:38:50,999 --> 01:38:52,932
I'm going that way.

513
01:38:53,234 --> 01:38:56,871
It's a long way, but I'll make it!

514
01:38:57,036 --> 01:38:59,039
Good luck, Gerlost.

515
01:38:59,204 --> 01:39:01,841
My name's Ivan.

516
01:39:02,008 --> 01:39:06,277
Yes, that's what all Russians
are called.

517
01:39:06,445 --> 01:39:07,780
Gerlost Ivan.

518
01:39:10,013 --> 01:39:11,648
And you get lost too.

519
01:39:13,618 --> 01:39:18,721
{y:i}They parted on that hill.

520
01:39:19,322 --> 01:39:23,192
{y:i}The snow came early that year.

521
01:39:24,494 --> 01:39:27,528
They left.

522
01:39:28,830 --> 01:39:34,166
One that way, the other
in that direction, to their homes.

523
01:39:35,835 --> 01:39:39,672
They were strong and brave people.

524
01:39:40,839 --> 01:39:44,276
They would have made good hunters.

525
01:39:44,444 --> 01:39:48,378
But the war made them
do bad things...

526
01:39:49,681 --> 01:39:52,582
...and they tired of it.

527
01:39:53,783 --> 01:39:59,790
They understood that
and stopped fighting each other.

528
01:40:00,957 --> 01:40:05,126
They became friends...

529
01:40:05,294 --> 01:40:08,296
...and heIped me with the chores.

530
01:40:09,297 --> 01:40:11,566
They aIways heIped each other.

531
01:40:11,731 --> 01:40:18,872
A bad man wounded one of them,
and the other brought him to me.

532
01:40:22,241 --> 01:40:26,913
I tended to his wound
and didn't Iet him die.

533
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:31,950
One day, I realized
they wanted to return...

534
01:40:32,115 --> 01:40:34,585
...to where their mothers
had born them.

535
01:40:35,585 --> 01:40:40,455
I sewed them warm clothing
and got food for the journey.

536
01:40:40,623 --> 01:40:46,895
They went to their farmsteads.

537
01:40:48,930 --> 01:40:52,199
And your fathers
were named like you.

538
01:40:52,367 --> 01:40:53,934
Gerlost...

539
01:40:54,869 --> 01:40:56,637
...and Veikko.

540
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:03,637
