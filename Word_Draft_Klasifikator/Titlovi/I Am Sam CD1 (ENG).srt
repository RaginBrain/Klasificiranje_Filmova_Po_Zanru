1
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,025
Oopsie.

2
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:53,488
Decaf double tall
nonfat capp for Bruce.

3
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,033
You got it, buddy.

4
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,869
That's a wonderful choice,
Bruce.

5
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:01,955
- Thank you, Sam. Take care.
- It certainly is.

6
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:06,502
One Caramel Macchiato.
It's very hot.

7
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,462
Good morning.

8
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,380
Vanilla grande no-foam latte.

9
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,090
That's a wonderful choice.

10
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,301
- Thanks, Sam.
- Yeah.

11
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,888
Hey, Sam. They called.
It's time for you to go.

12
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,516
Oh, yeah, it's time.

13
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,558
It's time, buddy.

14
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,604
It's time for me to go now.

15
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,524
It's time for me to go now,
George!

16
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,691
Good luck.

17
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,027
It's time.

18
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:36,949
It's time now.

19
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,004
Hurry up. The first floor
is two more floors.

20
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:53,423
Hurry up.

21
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,844
The second floor...
one more floor.

22
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,472
I have to go to Room 324
on the third floor.

23
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:07,187
Rebecca!

24
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,981
You the one responsible
for this?

25
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,482
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:12,901
Too late for sorries.
Get over here and hold her hand.

27
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:15,070
Are you OK?

28
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,115
Got a live one, Gert.

29
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:22,327
Good. Come on.
Focus and breathe.

30
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,413
This is it.

31
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,875
This is it.

32
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,920
This is it.

33
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:33,297
And it's a girl!

34
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,228
It's OK.

35
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,534
What's her name?

36
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:11,418
Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

37
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,964
Lucy Diamond Dawson.

38
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:28,352
You're my daughter.
I'm your father.

39
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:38,987
Get them to make the bus stay.
They're leaving.

40
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:40,989
- I'll get them.
- They're leaving.

41
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:44,326
Excuse me.
Hang on one second, please.

42
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,166
Becca!

43
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,460
Becca! The bus is going!

44
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,008
Uh-oh.

45
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,387
Didn't you just go to sleep?

46
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,019
Let me see.

47
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,481
OK.

48
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:01,028
Lucy, you look beautiful
this morning.

49
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,573
You look very beautiful.

50
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,711
Look at that, Lucy. Nose.

51
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:21,089
OK. Yeah, l...

52
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,091
Oopsie.

53
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,473
What the hell are you
doing to that baby?

54
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,854
What's the matter
with the baby, Sam?

55
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:21,567
Everything
is just so tiny, tiny.

56
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:24,236
Will you come over here
and help me?

57
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,739
You know I can't do that.
What does her mother say?

58
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,701
Her mother said,
"This isn't my life...

59
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,078
"and I didn't want
a baby with you.

60
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,497
"I just needed
a place to sleep."

61
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:38,500
What if the baby's sick?

62
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:41,336
Bring her over here.

63
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,674
Sam, babies need food
every two hours.

64
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:55,017
Sorry.
I'm sorry, Lucy in the sky.

65
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:57,186
You know...

66
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,855
critics and fools said that
that song...

67
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,400
had some mysterious meaning,
but John always said...

68
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,695
it came from a picture
his son Julian drew...

69
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,823
of his friend Lucy O'Connell.

70
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:14,119
So I made a good choice?

71
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:19,875
You made
an excellent choice, Sam.

72
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,504
Now, what time does
this little diamond wake up?

73
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:29,134
What time does
this little diamond wake up?

74
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,386
She wakes up all the time.

75
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:38,477
Let's just assume
she wakes up at 6:00.

76
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,607
Keep your TV on Nickelodeon.

77
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:45,275
I want you to feed her first...

78
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:49,279
when "Hogan's Heroes"
comes on.

79
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:56,203
And then again.
Wait until "I Dream of Jeannie."

80
00:08:56,245 --> 00:09:02,251
And then, feed her
when "I Love Lucy" comes on.

81
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,378
We have to be quiet.

82
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:07,089
I've seen nothing.
I know nothing!

83
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,594
Such a nice man for an officer.

84
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,189
What are you doing?

85
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:26,275
I'm just getting Lucy asleep...

86
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,026
and you're making noise
and everything.

87
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,279
- Oh, sorry.
- We're here for video night.

88
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:36,743
Eight years every Thursday
video night, and you forgot?

89
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:37,953
I'm sorry.

90
00:09:37,995 --> 00:09:42,916
It's always every first Thursday
of every month...

91
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,380
video night at Sam's house.
And I forgot.

92
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:50,048
Yeah, and I forgot.

93
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,051
Becca's gone.
"Gone with the Wind."

94
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:55,137
1939,
directed by Victor Fleming.

95
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:56,805
That was a very sad movie.

96
00:09:56,847 --> 00:10:01,560
Here we go.
Everything changes now.

97
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:04,313
Soon you'll forget about
Wednesday night at IHOP...

98
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:06,857
and then Friday night
at karaoke...

99
00:10:06,857 --> 00:10:10,319
and I got hit by a car today.

100
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,446
You did?

101
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:15,657
It was probably that guy
from the V.A.

102
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:19,077
Did you bring
"Kramer vs. Kramer"?

103
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:24,124
I see what's happening here.
I see.

104
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,626
So this is all my fault now.

105
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:27,336
Don't tell me you forgot again.

106
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:32,341
I broke a date with
a daydream to come here.

107
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:34,343
It's your mother.

108
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:38,347
Hi, Robert. Hello, boys.
It's me, Estelle.

109
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,059
Ma, I told you.
Video night's over at 9:00.

110
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,102
It's only 6:30.

111
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:50,901
Well, I guess
I'll just wait downstairs.

112
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:52,611
Sure there isn't anything
I can get you?

113
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,656
No, Ma. You can wait downstairs.
That's fine.

114
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,200
OK. See you later, Rob.

115
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,952
Bye, Estelle.

116
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,957
What a pretty baby.
Hi, little baby.

117
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,543
- Doesn't she look smart?
- She does.

118
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,378
She looks smart.

119
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,672
That baby looks so darn smart.

120
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:15,092
It's amazing how smart she is.

121
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:16,677
She's very smart.

122
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:20,013
She really does.
I think she's really beautiful.

123
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:21,890
Of course she looks smart.

124
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,101
She's already reading the paper.

125
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,662
Double Macchiato,
low fat, low foam.

126
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:45,414
That's a wonderful choice.

127
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:52,754
Oh, my God!

128
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,173
An ice cube went down...

129
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,049
Thank you. Oh, my God.

130
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,217
Can I get another drink, please?

131
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,888
Iced cappuccino.
That's a wonderful choice.

132
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:01,930
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

133
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:04,558
Annie, I can't take her
to work anymore...

134
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,685
because she's too big now.

135
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,229
- Annie.
- That was her first word.

136
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:11,773
- Annie.
- See?

137
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,943
People worry you're not smart.

138
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:17,404
Papa.

139
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:23,035
Yes. Oh, you smell so good.

140
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:26,622
You can tell a lot about people
by the way they smell.

141
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,640
Daddy, why does the snow flake?

142
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:47,809
Because snow...
because snow flakes.

143
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:50,270
Daddy, what is mustard made of?

144
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:53,482
Because it's yellow ketchup.

145
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,734
Daddy, why are men bald?

146
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:58,695
Sometimes they're bald
because their head is shiny...

147
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,531
and they don't have hair on it.

148
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:03,784
So their head
is just more of their face.

149
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,661
Daddy,
are ladybugs only girls...

150
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,329
or are there boys, too?

151
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,998
And if there are,
what are they called?

152
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,834
Yeah, the Beatles.

153
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,962
Daddy, where does the sky end?

154
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:16,839
Why does the moon
follow me home?

155
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,173
Why is the sun orange?

156
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,634
Where does the hour go
in Daylight Savings?

157
00:13:20,676 --> 00:13:24,179
Daddy, do I look more
like you or Mommy?

158
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,309
Daddy...

159
00:13:30,561 --> 00:13:33,188
Do you think
she'll ever come back?

160
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:43,907
Paul McCartney lost
his mother when he was little.

161
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:48,662
And John Lennon lost his mother
when he was little.

162
00:13:48,704 --> 00:13:53,834
Annie says that sometimes
God picks the special people.

163
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:55,878
That's what Annie says.

164
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:01,550
Daddy, did God mean for you
to be like this...

165
00:14:01,592 --> 00:14:03,552
or was it an accident?

166
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:08,807
What do you mean?

167
00:14:08,849 --> 00:14:10,350
I mean you're different.

168
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,858
But what do you mean?

169
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,527
You're not like other daddies.

170
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:28,035
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

171
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:31,246
Yeah, I'm sorry.

172
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:34,249
It's OK, Daddy.

173
00:14:35,751 --> 00:14:39,087
Don't be sorry. I'm lucky.

174
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,257
Nobody else's daddy
ever comes to the park.

175
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:55,229
Yeah, we are lucky.
Aren't we lucky?

176
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,688
Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity.

177
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,359
Sunnyside up, not too runny.
Two sausage links.

178
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,945
French pancakes
instead of buttermilk.

179
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,072
Fruit topping on the side.

180
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:06,573
The Funny Face special.

181
00:15:06,657 --> 00:15:09,785
I think it's funny when
you say "Funny Face special."

182
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:12,955
French, not buttermilk.
Fruit topping on the side.

183
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,289
Not on top.

184
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:16,875
You're getting a funny face.

185
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,675
That's a wonderful choice.
Thank you, Grace.

186
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,885
Thank you
very, very, very, very much.

187
00:15:26,927 --> 00:15:28,053
You got it, Sam.

188
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,596
Is that too big?

189
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,306
I think that's a little too big.

190
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:34,101
You need a pair of
good, sturdy school shoes.

191
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,269
These are sturdy.

192
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,563
The arches
are very important.

193
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,940
No. Sturdy is boring, Sam.

194
00:15:39,982 --> 00:15:44,611
These shoes light up, OK?

195
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:49,199
These are really good shoes
for school.

196
00:15:49,241 --> 00:15:50,450
I know. I love them.

197
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,911
I found the most perfect shoes.

198
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:56,123
They look like the shoes
that Dorothy wore...

199
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:58,584
played by Judy Garland
in "The Wizard of Oz"...

200
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,670
1939,
directed by Victor Fleming.

201
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,674
These are pink.
These are also Velcro.

202
00:16:05,716 --> 00:16:09,636
They might have
a little arch in there, too.

203
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:12,347
Sam, these are
probably too big...

204
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,601
but I thought maybe
Lucy would like those.

205
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:20,314
When we were at the zoo,
she liked the animal prints.

206
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:22,566
But these are for adults.

207
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,694
But when we went...
I don't know you.

208
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:26,862
I don't know who you are.

209
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,697
I like these, Daddy.

210
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:32,534
She knows what she likes.
That's why she likes these.

211
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:35,120
- Black goes with everything.
- How much are these?

212
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:37,456
$16.19 with tax.

213
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:43,003
Because I have $6.25.

214
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,505
That's all you have?

215
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:47,841
I didn't get my whole check
because I had to go...

216
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:51,220
to the parent and teacher
meeting this week.

217
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:54,890
I'm sorry. It's $16.19.

218
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:58,393
I couldn't go to work
all day that day.

219
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:01,563
It's OK, Sam, because
I have $3.00 to contribute.

220
00:17:01,605 --> 00:17:05,484
Sam, I've only got
two plus two...

221
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:11,031
but I need one for stamps,
so 1... 2... 3.

222
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,908
Joe's got $1.50.

223
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:17,830
Yeah. So, is that enough?

224
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:20,415
If there's a God.
I'll count it.

225
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,418
Do we get a balloon with these?

226
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:29,216
All of us, or just her?

227
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:08,130
"And I will eat them
here and there.

228
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,549
"I will eat them anywhere."

229
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:15,637
"I do so like
green eggs and ham.

230
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,056
"Thank you, thank you,
Sam I am."

231
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,852
One more time?

232
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:23,979
- Yeah.
- OK.

233
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:27,399
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

234
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,484
"I will eat them with a mouse.

235
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,486
"And I will eat them
here and there.

236
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,322
"Say, I will
eat them anywhere.

237
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,366
"I do so like
green eggs and ham.

238
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,994
"Thank you, thank you,
Sam I am."

239
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:42,331
One more time?

240
00:18:42,372 --> 00:18:45,209
Daddy, it's my first day
of school tomorrow.

241
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,712
I don't want to be too sleepy.

242
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:56,053
Everybody says Bob's Big Boy
has the best hamburgers.

243
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:59,306
Can we go there Wednesday
instead of IHOP?

244
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,808
But Wednesday is IHOP.

245
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,311
Just one time?

246
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,147
Yeah, but Wednesday is IHOP.

247
00:19:11,318 --> 00:19:14,530
Can I read just the beginning?

248
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:17,533
Just the beginning.

249
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,536
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

250
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:25,833
There are four stages
of a butterfly's life.

251
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:31,255
The first three stages are
from egg to larva to cocoon.

252
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:35,676
Last...

253
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:39,304
They're hard to remember
because there's so many stages.

254
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,807
It's hard to remember.

255
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:44,893
33 days. It lasts 33 days.

256
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:49,398
Spiders and insects
are members of the ants...

257
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:51,692
ants... anthro...

258
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:55,070
Conner. Anthropod class.

259
00:19:55,112 --> 00:19:57,239
Anthropod class.

260
00:19:57,281 --> 00:20:01,410
However, spiders and insects
are very different.

261
00:20:01,451 --> 00:20:04,621
- Spiders have six legs...
- Eight legs.

262
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:08,750
Eight legs and two body parts,
and they're called...

263
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,420
Conner. What are you doing?
You know this stuff.

264
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,754
- No, I don't.
- You do know it.

265
00:20:12,796 --> 00:20:15,257
You wrote that part,
remember?

266
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,385
I wanted to do potato bugs
anyway. Oh, forget it.

267
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,555
I think he can make
that boy feel better.

268
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:24,933
Sorry, Mr. Egg.

269
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,685
What's wrong with your father?

270
00:20:26,727 --> 00:20:28,729
Why's he acts like a retard?

271
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,439
He is.

272
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,066
- Are you?
- No.

273
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:35,152
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

274
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:36,153
How do you know?

275
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:37,529
He told me.

276
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,947
He's a retard.

277
00:20:38,989 --> 00:20:41,200
Well, it takes one to know one.

278
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:45,412
It's wonderful to have you
for company tonight.

279
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:48,749
Isn't it wonderful to have
Conner for company, Lucy?

280
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,504
Yeah. "Sorry, Mr. Egg."

281
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:00,010
"They per..."

282
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,682
"They perched in...

283
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:07,893
"Si...

284
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,353
silen..."

285
00:21:11,563 --> 00:21:13,607
Silence.

286
00:21:13,649 --> 00:21:16,443
Yeah. Silence.

287
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:21,406
"They perched in silence
for a long time."

288
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:25,536
Your teacher gave you
a really hard book this time.

289
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:28,163
That's really
a hard book to read.

290
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:33,877
"How can we be so..."

291
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,799
Differ...

292
00:21:38,841 --> 00:21:40,008
Different.

293
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,970
Oh, yeah. OK.

294
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:49,935
"How can we be so different
and feel so much alike?"

295
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:51,478
I don't like that book.

296
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,981
Let's read
"Green Eggs and Ham."

297
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:57,693
Yeah! OK.

298
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:01,071
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

299
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:08,036
"Green Eggs and Ham"
by Dr. Seuss.

300
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:10,289
"I am Sam."

301
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:19,173
Hey, you.

302
00:22:19,256 --> 00:22:21,717
Hey, handsome.

303
00:22:25,387 --> 00:22:28,932
"Premature baby
claims he's Cupid.

304
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:32,644
"Has arrow to prove it."
You believe that?

305
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:37,149
But if he has the arrow,
that's the only thing.

306
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,610
You got a good point.

307
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,906
This is the International
House of Pancakes quiz.

308
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:46,867
And Lucy found the word "beet."

309
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:50,787
I want to surprise her
and find the word "carrot"...

310
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:52,247
but it's hiding.

311
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:54,166
Carrot!

312
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:57,169
- Where?
- C-a-r-r... carrot.

313
00:22:57,252 --> 00:23:00,005
Carrot. It's right there.

314
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:05,219
And you're smart.
You would be a good mother.

315
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,431
Do you tell good stories?

316
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:12,434
- I got stories up the wazoo.
- Really?

317
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:13,602
You come with me and relax...

318
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:16,063
and I'll tell you
some nice stories.

319
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:19,399
Lily, what did I tell you
about selling on my beat?

320
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:22,611
Put it down on the table.

321
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:25,447
It's the International
House of Pancakes quiz.

322
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,782
Put your hands behind your head.

323
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:27,950
What did l...

324
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,535
Do you have any weapons on you?

325
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,457
He touched me
on my private place.

326
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:41,964
At such a time as this,
Annie's the boss.

327
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,842
First time in 19 years
I actually believe a guy...

328
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:46,635
when he says he didn't know
she was a hooker.

329
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:48,470
You say that like
it's a good thing.

330
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:50,639
Did you brush your teeth?

331
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:53,684
They don't sound
like they were brushed.

332
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:58,397
She forgot to brush her teeth.

333
00:23:58,438 --> 00:24:00,482
Let him go.

334
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:02,651
Says he never spent
the night away from his kid.

335
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:10,033
Trouble. Oh, boy,
I'm really in trouble.

336
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,998
Are you in trouble, too?

337
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,211
Are you in trouble, too?

338
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:24,006
Yeah, I'm in trouble, too.

339
00:24:26,258 --> 00:24:31,096
It gives us great insight
into what she must be feeling.

340
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,473
Mr. Dawson,
it's becoming clear...

341
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:36,977
that she's holding herself
back in the classroom.

342
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:40,522
It's as if she's literally
afraid to learn.

343
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:43,692
No one doubts
that you love your daughter.

344
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,572
But the Department
of Child and Family Services...

345
00:24:48,614 --> 00:24:50,157
contacted us.

346
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:52,326
They shared with us
that your records show...

347
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:55,287
that your
intellectual capacity...

348
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,748
is around that of a 7-year-old.

349
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:05,214
Our concern is what happens
when Lucy turns 8.

350
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:10,010
Mr. Dawson,
do you understand...

351
00:25:10,052 --> 00:25:12,304
what Ms. Wright is trying
to tell you about Lucy?

352
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:28,570
John wanted to try new things.

353
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:34,409
And it wasn't Yoko's fault.

354
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:37,246
No, it wasn't Yoko's fault.

355
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:43,085
Annie says you can hear it
on The White Album.

356
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:51,218
Because John wanted
to try new things.

357
00:25:57,558 --> 00:26:04,481
"They perched in silence.
How can we be so diff..."

358
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:09,820
Diff... diff...
I don't know that word.

359
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:18,287
Yes, you do. That's the word
that starts with a "D."

360
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:20,873
I'm tired.

361
00:26:20,914 --> 00:26:23,208
I don't believe you.

362
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,461
Are you calling me a liar?

363
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:30,215
Yes. I think
you have to read the word.

364
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:31,925
No.

365
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:33,343
Yeah, you have to read
that word.

366
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:34,553
No.

367
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,221
Yeah. Here it is.

368
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,057
There's the picture
where they're all perched.

369
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,226
- Now read the word.
- No!

370
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,773
I won't read the word!

371
00:26:46,815 --> 00:26:49,401
I'm your father...

372
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:52,738
and I'm telling you
to read the word.

373
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,950
I can tell you to
because I'm your father.

374
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:59,578
I'm stupid.

375
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,831
- You are not stupid.
- Yes, I am.

376
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:07,044
You are not stupid,
because you can read that word.

377
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,340
I don't want to read it
if you can't.

378
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:18,972
No, because it makes me happy.

379
00:27:19,014 --> 00:27:21,850
It makes me happy
hearing you read.

380
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:32,736
Yeah. It makes me happy
when you're reading.

381
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:40,494
"They perched in silence
for a long time.

382
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,996
'How can we be so different...

383
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,707
and feel so much alike? '
Mused Flitter.

384
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,709
'How can we feel
so different...

385
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,379
and be so much alike? '
Wondered Pip.

386
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,756
'I think
this is quite a mystery."'

387
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,343
Keep going.

388
00:27:56,385 --> 00:27:58,887
They have Oreo
ice cream mud pie.

389
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:00,430
This is so great.

390
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,933
Yeah, this is so great.

391
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,770
And the menu says...

392
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:10,190
you can have your
favorite breakfast all day.

393
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:12,651
That's so great, too, you know.

394
00:28:12,693 --> 00:28:15,946
Because you wanted
to come to a new place...

395
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:19,741
so we came
to a different place.

396
00:28:23,287 --> 00:28:25,914
Hey, guys.
Can I get you coffee?

397
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,502
No, I don't drink coffee.

398
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:33,922
OK. What can I get you guys?

399
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:36,758
I'd like the Super Big Boy
with a root beer float, please.

400
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,261
OK. What about you?

401
00:28:39,303 --> 00:28:48,520
I would like to have
two eggs, sunnyside up.

402
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:50,939
But not runny, OK?

403
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:52,191
Not runny.

404
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:55,152
And then I would like
to have French pancakes...

405
00:28:55,194 --> 00:28:57,905
with the fruit topping
on the side.

406
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:01,366
We don't have French pancakes.

407
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:02,367
We have French toast.

408
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:03,785
No, I don't want French toast.

409
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:06,455
I want French pancakes,
like at IHOP.

410
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:10,542
Just the same kind
like they have at IHOP.

411
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:12,920
That's what my favorite
breakfast is, OK?

412
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,421
They're those thin pancakes.

413
00:29:14,463 --> 00:29:17,174
The crepe pancakes?

414
00:29:17,216 --> 00:29:18,509
I don't even want crepes.

415
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,636
I want to have
French pancakes...

416
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,304
with the fruit topping
on the side.

417
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:25,599
That's what
I want to have, please.

418
00:29:25,641 --> 00:29:26,683
Thank you.

419
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:29,311
We don't have that, though, sir.

420
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:31,605
Do you want
regular pancakes and jam...

421
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:34,816
I don't want something else!
Why did you ask me that?

422
00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,402
I'll see.
Maybe they have something...

423
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:40,447
- Yeah, ask Bob!
- OK.

424
00:29:40,489 --> 00:29:42,449
Ask Bob's Big Boy.

425
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,827
Because the customer's
always right.

426
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:46,537
I understand that...

427
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,997
The customer's always right.

428
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:45,345
Because when Lucy comes
through the door...

429
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,848
everybody says, "surprise!"

430
00:30:47,931 --> 00:30:50,475
You gotta stop bouncing
for a second.

431
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,728
You'll say, "surprise!"

432
00:30:52,769 --> 00:30:54,062
Can we keep bouncing?

433
00:30:54,104 --> 00:30:56,607
You'll have to come down.

434
00:30:56,648 --> 00:31:00,277
After Lucy gets here
and we say, "surprise."

435
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:02,905
So you have to assume
surprise position.

436
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:05,741
Should we rehearse it
one more time?

437
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:10,412
Assume the surprise position.

438
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,915
Annie was supposed to warn us.

439
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,000
Brad, hit the light.

440
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,922
Surprise!

441
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,632
It's not her.

442
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,675
Hi. I don't know
if you remember me.

443
00:31:23,717 --> 00:31:25,761
I'm Margaret Calgrove...

444
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:28,096
Department of
Child and Family Services.

445
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:30,098
We met at the police station.

446
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,600
Put the present there.

447
00:31:31,642 --> 00:31:33,727
You have to hurry,
because Lucy's coming.

448
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:35,229
Come on, hide with us.

449
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,897
Come on, over here.

450
00:31:42,069 --> 00:31:44,780
Annie said Lucy's coming up
the stairs right now.

451
00:31:44,822 --> 00:31:47,741
So you have to assume
the surprise position.

452
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:49,117
I bet she already knows.

453
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:51,954
Why are you being
a party pooper?

454
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,455
She's coming now.

455
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,457
You have to assume
the surprise position.

456
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,252
Don't touch me.
I've got cooties!

457
00:31:58,293 --> 00:31:59,628
It's contagious!

458
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:02,464
Hey, what are you doing?
Get your hands off him.

459
00:32:02,506 --> 00:32:03,507
What are you doing
touching my kid?

460
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:06,260
- Surprise!
- Leave him alone!

461
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:09,054
Happy birthday.

462
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:10,472
Daddy?

463
00:32:10,514 --> 00:32:11,723
You don't
have to call him Daddy.

464
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:14,142
She said you're not
her real father anyway.

465
00:32:14,184 --> 00:32:16,770
She said she was adopted.

466
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,405
Lucy!

467
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,073
Given the fact
that the father...

468
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,325
was arrested
for solicitation...

469
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:32,161
couldn't control
his emotions...

470
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,329
endangering other children.

471
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:38,959
No, you can't!
It's her birthday!

472
00:32:39,001 --> 00:32:41,211
Ms. Calgrove also cites...

473
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:44,256
Mr. Dawson's mental delays
which raise serious questions...

474
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,675
about his ability
to properly parent.

475
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:48,427
Run!

476
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,179
I find at this time...

477
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,848
it's not in the best interest of
the child to remain in the home.

478
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,558
And I order her detained...

479
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:58,061
until a formal
jurisdictional hearing.

480
00:32:58,103 --> 00:33:00,606
Mr. Dawson.

481
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:03,400
Is there anything
you'd like to add?

482
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:10,157
I wanted to make it
a really special surprise party.

483
00:33:10,199 --> 00:33:14,036
So I went, and I got plates
at the Pic 'n' Save...

484
00:33:14,077 --> 00:33:19,208
in yellow and in pink...
like a princess.

485
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,710
And then I went
to the toy store...

486
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:25,047
and I got balloons
with the helium in them.

487
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,298
- Mr. Dawson?
- Yeah.

488
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,761
It sounds like you gave her
such a lovely party.

489
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:32,554
Yes, I'm sure it was.

490
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:36,975
Right now, I want to talk to you
about your legal rights.

491
00:33:37,017 --> 00:33:38,852
OK. There's room
at this table...

492
00:33:38,894 --> 00:33:42,231
if anybody wants
to sit next to me.

493
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,149
I just want to talk to you
about your legal rights...

494
00:33:44,191 --> 00:33:48,278
so if you have not already
retained legal counsel...

495
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,614
the court will appoint
someone for you...

496
00:33:50,656 --> 00:33:54,910
to present your case
on January 5. OK?

497
00:33:57,871 --> 00:33:59,665
That's a month from now...

498
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:03,252
so I come back here
in one month with Lucy.

499
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:07,840
No, Mr. Dawson. You will have
monitored visits...

500
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:12,553
two times a week
for two hours.

501
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:16,014
And now we're moving on
to 4-D, Parker...

502
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:18,725
What do you mean?

503
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:24,231
You will see Lucy
two times a week for two hours.

504
00:34:24,273 --> 00:34:27,609
Why isn't Lucy
going home with me?

505
00:34:27,651 --> 00:34:31,905
I want her to go home with me.

506
00:34:31,947 --> 00:34:34,783
Not today.
Thank you, Mr. Dawson.

507
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:38,787
4-D. Parker vs. Van Wert.
Thank you.

508
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:41,707
Of course the judge
picked the lawyer.

509
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:45,252
For God's sake,
put it together.

510
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:47,004
She's the one who took
Lucy away from you...

511
00:34:47,045 --> 00:34:49,381
so it's time that
you get your own lawyer now.

512
00:34:49,423 --> 00:34:51,300
You guys think I'm guilty?

513
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,844
- No, Sam.
- You didn't kill anybody.

514
00:34:53,844 --> 00:34:55,596
I miss Lucy, Sam.

515
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,306
Me, too.

516
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:58,974
You need
a personal injury lawyer...

517
00:34:59,016 --> 00:35:01,810
because you have been
personally injured.

518
00:35:01,852 --> 00:35:05,647
When Dustin Hoffman
was trying to keep Billy...

519
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,649
from going back
to Meryl Streep...

520
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:10,110
his lawyer told him that
it would cost him $15,000...

521
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:11,528
and that's if we win.

522
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:14,656
- $15,000!
- And that's if we win.

523
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,326
Don't worry about money, Sam.

524
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:22,206
Get the best. Century City.
Here. Look at that.

525
00:35:22,247 --> 00:35:23,874
Let me show you
what it looks like.

526
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,752
Rothman, Glenn,
Harrison, and Williams.

527
00:35:28,962 --> 00:35:31,965
This is one of the best ads
I've seen in the Yellow Pages.

528
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:33,258
So maybe we're going to win.

529
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:37,429
- We're gonna win.
- One of the best ads I've seen.

530
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:39,598
With Rothman and Glenn
and Harrison and Williams...

531
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,433
we're gonna win.

532
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:47,731
Did Fred Kimble call?
I'm already 20 minutes late.

533
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:50,526
What did Michelle Kresge say?
Was she defensive?

534
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:51,944
That's ridiculous.

535
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,695
What happened with my car?
Because it wasn't my fault.

536
00:35:53,737 --> 00:35:55,989
Oh, I know.

537
00:35:57,866 --> 00:35:59,952
This is Mr. Dawson.

538
00:35:59,993 --> 00:36:02,830
There was some confusion
with the temp last week...

539
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:04,248
How do you do? I'm Sam.

540
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:06,250
Mr. Dawson. It's a pleasure.

541
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:08,752
Since somebody made a mistake...

542
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:10,546
unfortunately
we only have a little time.

543
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:13,006
Hold my calls
unless it's my kid.

544
00:36:13,048 --> 00:36:14,174
I'll have a grande 2% capp.

545
00:36:14,216 --> 00:36:16,176
That's a wonderful choice.

546
00:36:17,386 --> 00:36:20,180
Can we get you something
to drink?

547
00:36:20,222 --> 00:36:21,849
Is it for free?

548
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:29,147
- My treat.
- OK. Thank you.

549
00:36:29,189 --> 00:36:31,650
Yeah, I would like
a glass of milk.

550
00:36:31,692 --> 00:36:34,403
Did you get that, Patricia?

551
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:36,405
Yes.

552
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:40,659
And Lucy
had an ice cream cake...

553
00:36:40,701 --> 00:36:44,288
with pink flowers...
not white...

554
00:36:44,329 --> 00:36:47,749
and she likes
cherry vanilla because...

555
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,918
If that's Jake Hiller,
put him through.

556
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,505
Jake, no.

557
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,048
So I got cherry...

558
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:57,593
- Your son's on line two.
- Did you get that?

559
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,094
Tell him to hold
for just one second.

560
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:00,721
I have to go. The what?

561
00:37:00,762 --> 00:37:03,223
...melted together as orange.

562
00:37:03,265 --> 00:37:05,767
No. Have a nice weekend.

563
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:08,729
And Brad wanted
a princess on top...

564
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,607
with little pink shoes.

565
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:13,025
I think there's a...

566
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:14,735
I think your son's on line two.

567
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:18,071
Oh, my God. Willy?

568
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:20,073
Patricia, get Willy back.

569
00:37:20,157 --> 00:37:22,409
Well, keep trying.

570
00:37:22,451 --> 00:37:26,872
Mr. Dawson, quite bluntly,
you can't afford to hire me.

571
00:37:26,955 --> 00:37:31,960
Yeah, because I make
$8.00 an hour at Starbucks.

572
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:34,713
Per hour. It's an hourly rate.

573
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:36,465
I could pay you per hour.

574
00:37:36,507 --> 00:37:38,217
Mr. Dawson, I'm sorry,
but I have...

575
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:42,804
I have to be in court in
eight minutes with the Kresges.

576
00:37:42,846 --> 00:37:46,892
But good luck to you.
Don't give up.

577
00:37:46,934 --> 00:37:49,853
I'm not giving up.
Where am I going?

578
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:51,313
I can show you out.

579
00:37:54,191 --> 00:37:56,109
Patricia, where are my keys?

580
00:37:56,151 --> 00:37:58,987
This is her
on her first birthday.

581
00:37:59,029 --> 00:38:02,366
December 6.
That's her birthday.

582
00:38:02,407 --> 00:38:04,785
And this is Lucy two years old.

583
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:08,956
This is Lucy seven years old
on her birthday...

584
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:11,333
the day they took her away.

585
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,334
Your son's on line two.

586
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:15,003
Willy, hi.

587
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,965
Jackson told Wyatt he wasn't
my best friend anymore.

588
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:20,300
Could we possibly talk
about this when I get home?

589
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:25,347
Willy? Come on, you're
not gonna talk to me now?

590
00:38:25,389 --> 00:38:29,685
I bought a bag of your favorite
lemonade jellybeans.

591
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:47,870
God!

592
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:50,497
I hate that stupid coffee table.

593
00:38:50,539 --> 00:38:52,958
How many times, Patricia,
have I told you...

594
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,210
to get rid of
that crappy coffee table?

595
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:04,344
It's OK.

596
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:19,526
You have a son, Rita Rothman
Glenn Harrison Williams.

597
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:23,447
If they took him
away from you...

598
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:25,449
would you do what
Robert said and got...

599
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:29,703
the fastest-talking,
four-name lawyer you could?

600
00:39:32,331 --> 00:39:35,709
I may know someone who handles
these kinds of cases.

601
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:39,588
I'll see if she can help you.
Leave your number with Patricia.

602
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:41,590
Your therapist
is on line one.

603
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:43,842
Tell him you can't find me.

604
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,599
I'm gonna leave my number
with you, OK?

605
00:39:54,770 --> 00:40:00,692
I'm ready to make coffee.
Decaf nonfat latte.

606
00:40:00,776 --> 00:40:05,781
It's coffee up to here,
nonfat milk up to here...

607
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:10,786
and chocolate
or cinnamon sprinkles.

608
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:12,371
That's pretty good, Sam.
I'll think about it.

609
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,873
We'll come up with a promotion
that's good for you.

610
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:21,880
But I know what that means.

611
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:27,135
When I worked as a janitor
at the La Reina Theater...

612
00:40:27,177 --> 00:40:31,056
I asked Mr. Jenkins
if I could be a ticket-taker...

613
00:40:31,098 --> 00:40:33,934
and he said
he would think about it.

614
00:40:33,976 --> 00:40:38,105
And Jimmy Peters got the job.

615
00:40:38,146 --> 00:40:41,108
And he let his friends
in for free.

616
00:40:41,149 --> 00:40:42,943
I promise you, Sam.

617
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:44,153
We'll come up
with something for you.

618
00:40:44,194 --> 00:40:45,988
You have my word.

619
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:48,282
Word, words, words.
I need more than that.

620
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:51,285
I need to make coffee.

621
00:40:51,368 --> 00:40:54,204
I need to pay my lawyer.

622
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,584
I am celebrating
congratulations to us.

623
00:40:58,625 --> 00:41:01,837
These are the moments.
Good night.

624
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:09,303
Grande, 2% capp.
I brought that for you.

625
00:41:09,386 --> 00:41:13,140
By any chance,
did you call your friend?

626
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:16,268
The one
that does this kind of work?

627
00:41:18,312 --> 00:41:21,440
I don't have her number anymore.

628
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,984
We lost touch.

629
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:26,695
Yeah, that happens.

630
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:28,739
If you get
back in touch with her...

631
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,242
and you find her number,
will you call me?

632
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,244
I'm just in the middle of...

633
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:36,205
It's a special...

634
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:37,331
Yeah, I'll call you.

635
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:40,459
OK. Yeah.

636
00:41:40,501 --> 00:41:41,627
Is that the new janitor?

637
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:45,464
Oh, it's a...

638
00:41:45,506 --> 00:41:47,299
a case I'm helping out with...

639
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,259
sort of a pro bono thing.

640
00:41:51,386 --> 00:41:52,679
What's that supposed to mean?

641
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:56,850
Cracker went down
the wrong pipe.

642
00:41:56,892 --> 00:41:59,019
You think I don't do pro bono?

643
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:01,772
Have another glass, please.
On me.

644
00:42:01,813 --> 00:42:05,108
No, on you. It's pro bono.

645
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,069
I do pro bono.

646
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,488
I know. You go, girl.

647
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:12,157
You just spread that love.
Spread it all around.

648
00:42:22,793 --> 00:42:26,755
Stop. Driver, stop the bus.

649
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:28,924
Stop the bus.

650
00:42:38,225 --> 00:42:41,770
Wait for me. I got it.

651
00:42:41,812 --> 00:42:44,815
Lucy, he's an hour
and 45 minutes late.

652
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:47,276
You'll only have
a few minutes left.

653
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,946
You can leave if you want.

654
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:53,198
- Lucy!
- Daddy?

655
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,325
I'm here. I'm here.

656
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:57,494
It's Daddy. I told you!

657
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:58,620
Oh, shoot!

658
00:42:58,662 --> 00:43:01,290
I spilled it all. Hi.

659
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,878
And guess her name is.

660
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:08,630
Her name is Rita Harrison.

661
00:43:08,672 --> 00:43:10,966
Lovely Rita Meter Maid?

662
00:43:11,008 --> 00:43:14,761
Yeah, and Harrison like George.

663
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,271
Is she going to help us?

664
00:43:24,313 --> 00:43:28,358
She can't help us...

665
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:30,944
but if she ever finds
her friend's number...

666
00:43:31,028 --> 00:43:36,450
who does this kind of cases,
she's gonna call me.

667
00:43:39,786 --> 00:43:42,498
You've grown.

668
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:43,957
Have I?

669
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:46,460
Yeah. Because your ears
are bigger...

670
00:43:46,502 --> 00:43:48,462
and your eyes are older.

671
00:43:54,885 --> 00:43:59,306
Guess what I'm gonna get
when I get my next paycheck?

672
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:01,683
I'm gonna get
an answering machine...

673
00:44:01,725 --> 00:44:04,520
because then you can call
and leave a message.

674
00:44:04,561 --> 00:44:08,357
You can say,
"Hi. This is Lucy."

675
00:44:08,398 --> 00:44:10,359
We can't afford
an answering machine.

676
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,529
Yeah, because
I'm gonna get a big promotion...

677
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:16,281
a promotion that's big.

678
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,450
They'll let you make coffee?

679
00:44:18,492 --> 00:44:23,288
Always set
your dreams high, Lucy.

680
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:28,043
I'm sorry, Daddy.

681
00:44:28,085 --> 00:44:29,837
It was all my fault.

682
00:44:29,878 --> 00:44:33,590
Don't say that.

683
00:44:33,632 --> 00:44:36,343
It was not all your fault,
so don't say that.

684
00:44:37,344 --> 00:44:40,138
I wouldn't want
any daddy but you.

685
00:44:46,478 --> 00:44:48,605
Did you hear that?

686
00:44:48,647 --> 00:44:51,066
I said I was sorry!

687
00:44:51,108 --> 00:44:53,735
I said I didn't want
any daddy but him.

688
00:44:53,777 --> 00:44:56,405
Why don't you write that down?

689
00:44:58,574 --> 00:45:02,703
Let me make sure
that I'm clear here.

690
00:45:02,744 --> 00:45:04,872
Are you telling me
neither of you...

691
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:06,373
wants custody of your child?

692
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:08,876
He has created a monster.

693
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,586
He is exactly like him.

694
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:13,422
Here we go again.
It's the same old story.

695
00:45:13,463 --> 00:45:15,591
The tears and the tears.

696
00:45:15,632 --> 00:45:18,093
Oh, my God.
Are you really...

697
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:19,595
You cannot stand emotion.

698
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:22,264
I'm right here with you.
Excuse me.

699
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:25,058
I'm sorry.

700
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:29,271
Hi! Did you get in touch
with your friend?

701
00:45:29,313 --> 00:45:31,899
Because I need legal advice now.

702
00:45:32,983 --> 00:45:34,693
You said
I couldn't afford you...

703
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:37,070
so I have to talk to somebody.

704
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:47,789
That's why I told you
I would be your lawyer pro bono.

705
00:45:47,831 --> 00:45:52,544
I don't understand
exactly what you mean.

706
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:55,130
You told me
that you would be my lawyer?

707
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:56,298
Sam, I'm your...

708
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:59,301
Golly, because
I must have misunderstood.

709
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:01,428
I told you that
when we first met.

710
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,223
You said
you would be my lawyer?

711
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:05,891
Yes. Sam...

712
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:09,645
You're my lawyer!

713
00:46:09,686 --> 00:46:11,563
That's right. I'm your lawyer.

714
00:46:11,605 --> 00:46:13,565
And I can pay you per hour.

715
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:15,609
- No, no, no.
- On the hour.

716
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:17,486
Pro bono. It's free.

717
00:46:19,196 --> 00:46:21,281
My lawyer for free.

718
00:46:21,365 --> 00:46:23,617
Now, you... God.

719
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:27,663
Thank you.
Because I have to get this.

720
00:46:27,704 --> 00:46:30,415
It's "Urgent, open immediately"

721
00:46:30,457 --> 00:46:32,501
For my lawyer for free!

722
00:46:34,378 --> 00:46:37,172
They want to have you
evaluated by a shrink...

723
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:41,093
and your appointment is today!
At 3:00.

724
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,636
It's today! It's now.

725
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:44,638
I don't actually
want to go to a shrink.

726
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,223
Sam, you don't actually
have a choice.

727
00:46:46,265 --> 00:46:47,307
It's court-ordered.

728
00:46:47,391 --> 00:46:50,811
The lady in your office
is crying.

729
00:46:53,689 --> 00:46:55,315
Patricia,
I'm in the middle of a meeting.

730
00:46:55,357 --> 00:46:56,692
Can you get him out of here?

731
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:59,027
Don't feel bad.

732
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:00,988
Sam, come with me.

733
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:02,406
Don't feel bad.

734
00:47:02,447 --> 00:47:04,032
We'll get through this.
Will you excuse us?

735
00:47:04,074 --> 00:47:08,537
It's their turn now, not yours.
Theirs.

736
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,039
If you leave now,
you can make this...

737
00:47:11,081 --> 00:47:12,541
and you have to make it.

738
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:16,253
But I have to take
the number 13...

739
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:20,966
downtown Wilshire express
to Grand Street...

740
00:47:21,008 --> 00:47:26,430
then I transfer to the number 34
at Cesar Chavez Avenue...

741
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:29,141
because that used
to be Brooklyn Avenue...

742
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:32,019
and my grandfather
had a bakery on it...

743
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,937
when it was Brooklyn Avenue.

744
00:47:33,979 --> 00:47:37,316
I don't think I can get there
at the time I'm supposed to.

745
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:41,320
Go, for Christ sakes!
Green means "Go."

746
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:43,739
I don't like to go to shrinks.

747
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,991
You and me both.

748
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:48,118
Right or left?

749
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,996
Which is it gonna be,
bonehead?

750
00:47:51,038 --> 00:47:52,498
Right turn ahead.

751
00:47:52,581 --> 00:47:53,540
Right on Vermont?

752
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:55,918
That'll be another 20 minutes,
you idiot!

753
00:47:58,045 --> 00:48:01,757
Did your mommy make you
go to a shrink, too?

754
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:05,260
No. Well, sort of.

755
00:48:05,344 --> 00:48:07,262
I spent the whole time
talking about her.

756
00:48:07,304 --> 00:48:09,932
Well, that's nice.

757
00:48:11,433 --> 00:48:14,019
- Office.
- Dialing home.

758
00:48:14,061 --> 00:48:16,522
Office! God damn it!

759
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:21,109
You're going much faster
than everybody else.

760
00:48:21,151 --> 00:48:24,404
I wonder if you noticed that,
because I noticed that.

761
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,240
Go!

762
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,126
No more shrinks.

763
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:41,505
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dawson...

764
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:45,092
but if I were you, I wouldn't
waste any more of my time.

765
00:48:45,175 --> 00:48:50,889
Sorry, Mrs. Dawson, but I think
you should put Sam in a home.

766
00:48:50,931 --> 00:48:54,226
Sam in a home.

767
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,353
Mr. Dawson,
you do understand...

768
00:48:56,395 --> 00:48:58,772
that since I'm a
court-appointed psychologist...

769
00:48:58,814 --> 00:49:01,817
the traditional client-therapist
confidentiality...

770
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:04,153
will be waived.

771
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:05,904
Do you understand that?

772
00:49:05,946 --> 00:49:08,240
That the confidentiality
will be waived.

773
00:49:12,995 --> 00:49:15,622
Good. Let's begin.

774
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:20,210
I went to a doctor one time
who had an orange office.

775
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:25,382
All the walls
were painted orange.

776
00:49:25,424 --> 00:49:29,011
Do you know her?
She has an orange office...

777
00:49:29,052 --> 00:49:31,430
and she's in Van Nuys.

778
00:49:31,471 --> 00:49:33,348
I wanted to ask you about Lucy.

779
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:34,683
How old is she now?

780
00:49:34,725 --> 00:49:37,978
She's six. She's seven.

781
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,439
She just had a birthday,
I think.

782
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,693
How was that party?

783
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:49,948
"Before you read
your message...

784
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,951
"press the red button
for record."

785
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:56,872
Let's start with the O.G.M.

786
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:03,378
What? I don't know.
I don't think it's working.

787
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,215
I think it's because
it's a used machine.

788
00:50:06,256 --> 00:50:09,885
It's not used. It's pre-owned.

789
00:50:09,927 --> 00:50:13,055
A guy bought it
for his auto shop...

790
00:50:13,096 --> 00:50:14,723
and then he got a secretary.

791
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:16,350
Testing, 1, 2, 3.

792
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:18,852
That's a good code.

793
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:22,689
I can remember that... 1, 2, 3.

794
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:23,982
4, 5, 6.

795
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:25,984
7, 8, 9.

796
00:50:26,026 --> 00:50:28,237
9, 10, 11, 12.

797
00:50:28,278 --> 00:50:29,738
Quick. You're recording.

798
00:50:31,615 --> 00:50:33,575
Hi. This is...

799
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:36,495
Hi. This is Sam.
I'm not home.

800
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:38,997
No, you really
don't want to say that...

801
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,960
because you don't want
to tell them you're not home.

802
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,671
- Then I'm lying.
- Everybody's lying.

803
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,756
Sam, you are on the air.

804
00:50:47,798 --> 00:50:50,092
Hi. How are you?

805
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:53,846
Maybe you sound
a little bit too excited.

806
00:50:53,887 --> 00:50:57,850
And maybe you might think
about lowering your voice...

807
00:50:57,933 --> 00:50:59,685
so maybe Lucy can hear you.

808
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:01,228
Go, Sam.

809
00:51:01,311 --> 00:51:07,025
Hi, Lucy.
Thank you for calling me.

810
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:09,528
That was good.

811
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:12,531
But did I sound like
a good father?

812
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:17,619
But it's an outgoing message...

813
00:51:17,661 --> 00:51:21,290
so I think you need to sound
a little more outgoing.

814
00:51:21,331 --> 00:51:24,418
Hi. This is Sam.
I'm not ho... Shoot.

815
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:26,753
Hi. This is Sam!

816
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:32,217
I think you should
sound like a normal person.

817
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:35,429
From the heart.

818
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,014
From the heart.

819
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:40,100
This is... Hello.
Thank you for calling.

820
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:42,019
This is Sam.

821
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:43,395
Wow.

822
00:51:43,437 --> 00:51:47,774
I feel that was a very touching
moment right there.

823
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:49,902
I felt that one.

824
00:51:49,943 --> 00:51:52,905
High-five.

825
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:57,868
We have a lot to go over,
and I have five minutes.

826
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:00,496
Rothman, Glenn,
Harrison, Williams...

827
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,247
is on the 29th floor.

828
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:03,790
That's 29 floors up...

829
00:52:03,874 --> 00:52:06,627
and the elevators
are actually over there.

830
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:10,130
Keep up.
Got to do my cardio. 120.

831
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:12,257
Got to get to 125
to make it count.

832
00:52:12,299 --> 00:52:15,511
I need that list of names
from you...

833
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:17,513
people who can testify
that you're a good father...

834
00:52:17,554 --> 00:52:18,847
despite your handicap.

835
00:52:18,889 --> 00:52:22,351
Just my husband.
I didn't mean your handicap.

836
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:24,394
I meant your disability.

837
00:52:24,478 --> 00:52:27,147
The fact that you're retarded...
that's not the right word.

838
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:28,649
I don't know what to call you.

839
00:52:30,734 --> 00:52:33,111
Sam. You can call me Sam.

840
00:52:33,153 --> 00:52:37,699
All right! Hello. Hi, Todd.

841
00:52:37,741 --> 00:52:40,327
I was out of range.
How you doing?

842
00:52:41,745 --> 00:52:44,540
What do you mean,
what's that supposed to mean?

843
00:52:46,375 --> 00:52:49,211
You're supposed
to be taking him to karate.

844
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:52,381
Are you eating?
No, I will not hold on.

845
00:52:52,422 --> 00:52:53,549
Go pick him up.

846
00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:56,510
I can't hear you.
I'm in the car.

847
00:52:56,552 --> 00:52:58,929
They put you through to me.

848
00:52:58,971 --> 00:53:01,223
I'm losing you.

849
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:06,061
What makes Sam a good father?

850
00:53:06,103 --> 00:53:10,524
The important thing is for
Sam to be a very good father...

851
00:53:10,607 --> 00:53:13,152
is to be there for her...

852
00:53:13,193 --> 00:53:19,533
because the smarter Lucy is,
the smarter she will get.

853
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:24,371
So what makes Sam a good father?

854
00:53:24,413 --> 00:53:27,166
Lucy's first word was "Annie..."

855
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:31,170
and her fifth word was "Joe."

856
00:53:31,253 --> 00:53:32,588
And I'm Joe.

857
00:53:36,049 --> 00:53:39,469
Sam is a very good father...

858
00:53:39,511 --> 00:53:42,973
because he likes green things...

859
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:44,766
like I like green things
very much.

860
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:47,144
I like green peas.

861
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:49,605
My cousin Luke works for
the organization...

862
00:53:49,646 --> 00:53:51,899
environmental organization
Greenpeace...

863
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,942
and they like
to save the whales.

864
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:55,486
I like whales.

865
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:57,988
"Moby Dick" was one of my
all-time favorite classics...

866
00:53:58,030 --> 00:53:59,281
by Herman Melville.

867
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:01,783
Wait.
Why are you recording this?

868
00:54:01,825 --> 00:54:03,869
It's often necessary...

869
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:05,454
You didn't say anything
about a tape recorder.

870
00:54:05,496 --> 00:54:08,457
- Who's listening?
- Me.

871
00:54:08,499 --> 00:54:10,667
What is that supposed to mean?

872
00:54:10,709 --> 00:54:11,877
Nothing.

873
00:54:11,919 --> 00:54:14,421
Who are you really?

874
00:54:16,757 --> 00:54:18,383
I need to speak
to my lawyer now.

875
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,949
I don't think you realize
what you're up against.

876
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:44,243
We have to be in court
in three days...

877
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:45,994
and we don't have
a decent witness.

878
00:54:46,036 --> 00:54:48,413
Now, you've got to know
someone who can testify...

879
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:49,790
who's been to college...

880
00:54:49,832 --> 00:54:52,251
or has a degree of some kind...

881
00:54:52,292 --> 00:54:55,254
or has some way
of expressing themselves...

882
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:58,173
that will make the court
believe you deserve...

883
00:54:58,173 --> 00:54:59,174
to get your daughter back.

884
00:54:59,174 --> 00:55:02,761
I need coffee. Big, tall.

885
00:55:02,803 --> 00:55:04,763
Tall is the smallest.

886
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:06,306
Yeah, of course.

887
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,308
Once you think of this person...

888
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:13,480
and there has to be one person,
call me at work.

889
00:55:13,522 --> 00:55:16,400
Because
I'm going back there now...

890
00:55:16,441 --> 00:55:20,988
to my seven other cases. What?

891
00:55:21,029 --> 00:55:24,449
Mrs. Robeck. I'm on the 405.

892
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:25,993
The traffic is horrible.

893
00:55:26,034 --> 00:55:28,620
You want this
for here or to go?

894
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:30,414
Dorothy?

895
00:55:31,415 --> 00:55:32,916
Oh, no. No.

896
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,128
Tow truck is towing your car.

897
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,005
Son of a bitch.

898
00:55:38,046 --> 00:55:39,840
It's towing your car.

899
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:44,011
No, wait! Stop!
It's my car. Stop.

900
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:46,388
But, Annie, it's just one day.

901
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:50,142
And Lucy needs you
because you went to college...

902
00:55:50,184 --> 00:55:54,563
and you can
give the right answers.

903
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:06,408
And we can't lose her.

904
00:56:08,827 --> 00:56:11,747
I'd make it worse for you.

905
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:14,249
I can't do it.

906
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:17,085
Don't you think I would
if I could?

907
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:24,092
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Phillip McNeilly.

908
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:31,850
Hi, guys.

909
00:56:31,892 --> 00:56:33,602
Hi, Sam.

910
00:56:33,644 --> 00:56:35,729
Boy, you did a wonderful job
making those signs.

911
00:56:35,813 --> 00:56:38,607
You're welcome, Sam.
Good luck, buddy.

912
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:40,150
Go get 'em.

913
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:44,363
Although,
at her birthday party...

914
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:48,450
I believe her true feelings
about her father were revealed.

915
00:56:48,492 --> 00:56:50,869
Objection.
"True feelings revealed"?

916
00:56:50,911 --> 00:56:52,955
Your Honor,
Ms. Davis is an expert...

917
00:56:52,996 --> 00:56:55,207
appointed by the court
for her opinion.

918
00:56:55,249 --> 00:56:56,291
I'll allow it.

919
00:56:56,375 --> 00:56:58,293
Then every child who rages...

920
00:56:58,335 --> 00:57:00,295
because they
didn't get to stay up...

921
00:57:00,379 --> 00:57:02,422
that extra hour to watch TV...

922
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:03,924
Any child who said
they hated their parents...

923
00:57:04,007 --> 00:57:05,259
because
they didn't want a bath...

924
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,261
would be a prime candidate
for foster care?

925
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:09,930
- Objection, Your Honor.
- Sustained.

926
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:12,057
I think they want you to stop.

927
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:14,309
Really?

928
00:57:14,309 --> 00:57:16,353
Thank you, Sam.

929
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:18,814
Yeah, OK.
Brad's wearing a tie today...

930
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:21,859
and I think the tie
looks wonderful on you, Brad.

931
00:57:21,942 --> 00:57:23,819
You look great, too.

932
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:29,616
There's a lady...
she's writing everything down.

933
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,744
Watch what you say.

934
00:57:32,786 --> 00:57:35,664
I have the best friends
in the whole world.

935
00:57:35,706 --> 00:57:39,334
Continue with your witness,
Mr. Turner.

936
00:57:39,334 --> 00:57:42,796
Ms. Davis, I assume
in your therapy session...

937
00:57:42,838 --> 00:57:46,508
that Mr. Dawson extolled
his parenting ability.

938
00:57:46,508 --> 00:57:48,051
On the contrary.

939
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:54,183
Mr. Dawson admitted
he felt very confused at times.

940
00:57:54,224 --> 00:57:56,268
Actually,
that he felt terrified...

941
00:57:56,351 --> 00:57:59,771
that he'd made and would
continue to make...

942
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:03,692
and I can quote here...

943
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:06,028
"Huge mistakes,
huge mistakes...

944
00:58:06,069 --> 00:58:07,529
"mistakes that are huge."

945
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:11,783
Thank you.
No further questions.

946
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:13,327
You're a mother,
aren't you, Ms. Davis?

947
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,329
Yes, I am.

948
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:19,374
Would it be fair to say that...

949
00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:22,836
as a parent, you've been
confused from time to time...

950
00:58:22,878 --> 00:58:25,172
possibly overwhelmed
on occasion...

951
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:26,632
even though
you're a wonderful mother?

952
00:58:26,673 --> 00:58:29,134
If Ms. Davis
has never had a moment...

953
00:58:29,218 --> 00:58:30,469
where she's been confused
as a mother...

954
00:58:30,511 --> 00:58:33,347
it would bias
her expert opinion.

955
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:36,225
I know that I have
many moments as a parent...

956
00:58:36,266 --> 00:58:38,727
where I felt
I've made huge mistakes.

957
00:58:38,811 --> 00:58:40,521
Objection.

958
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:42,564
Get to the relevant point,
Ms. Harrison.

959
00:58:42,606 --> 00:58:44,691
The point is, you've never
had those moments...

960
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:46,193
have you, Ms. Davis?

961
00:58:46,276 --> 00:58:49,404
Moments that every parent
I've ever spoken to has.

962
00:58:49,446 --> 00:58:52,908
Moments where the task is
so unbelievably challenging...

963
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,827
that you feel retarded...

964
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:56,745
disabled in some way.

965
00:58:56,787 --> 00:59:00,207
Moments where everyone seems
to have the key but you.

966
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,750
Really, to be honest...

967
00:59:01,834 --> 00:59:03,710
Yes or no?
Please answer the question.

968
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:05,712
I didn't really
feel right now...

969
00:59:05,796 --> 00:59:07,256
Let me rephrase the question.

970
00:59:07,297 --> 00:59:09,550
- When your son O.D.'d...
- Objection.

971
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:11,927
If Ms. Davis didn't feel
she had made mistakes...

972
00:59:11,969 --> 00:59:13,220
mistakes that were huge...

973
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:15,430
it might bias her opinion
toward Mr. Dawson.

974
00:59:15,472 --> 00:59:17,224
I'll allow it.

975
00:59:17,266 --> 00:59:20,394
Ms. Davis,
when your son O.D.'d...

976
00:59:20,435 --> 00:59:24,857
did you feel that you
might have made mistakes...

977
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:26,817
mistakes that were huge?

978
00:59:30,154 --> 00:59:32,114
Yes.

979
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:35,200
Yes.

980
00:59:35,242 --> 00:59:37,119
No further questions.

981
00:59:41,456 --> 00:59:43,417
You made her cry.

982
00:59:43,458 --> 00:59:44,459
I got lucky.

983
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:46,962
Oh, no.
That's not nice to make her cry.

984
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:48,130
Only in there.

985
00:59:48,172 --> 00:59:51,967
And your secretary
when you hated your desk.

986
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:56,638
Green and yellow
on the same plate.

987
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,474
Could you separate
the lima beans...

988
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:01,435
from the corn, please?

989
01:00:01,477 --> 01:00:04,229
Sam, don't be impossible.

990
01:00:04,271 --> 01:00:06,815
Can I have
the spinach omelette...

991
01:00:06,857 --> 01:00:08,984
only egg whites,
no fat, no oil, no butter.

992
01:00:09,026 --> 01:00:11,028
- And extra mushrooms?
- Absolutely.

993
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:15,115
My treat.

994
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:16,825
- No, no, no...
- My treat.

995
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:18,327
My pro bono.

996
01:00:18,368 --> 01:00:22,414
That means she doesn't
have to pay. I pay.

997
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:28,291
Sam, do you really
want to get this...

998
01:00:28,332 --> 01:00:31,335
or are you just trying to...

999
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:34,839
trying to act like a...

1000
01:00:35,881 --> 01:00:38,384
What do you mean?

1001
01:00:40,761 --> 01:00:43,598
You know, like... Never mind.

1002
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:45,600
I'm a grownup.

1003
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,935
I didn't say that.

1004
01:00:47,977 --> 01:00:49,312
You think what they think.

1005
01:00:49,353 --> 01:00:52,773
You're my lawyer,
and you think what they think?

1006
01:00:52,773 --> 01:00:54,275
I don't have a chance.

1007
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:57,153
I think...

1008
01:00:57,194 --> 01:00:58,904
you deserve a fair trial.

1009
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:00,906
Do you think what they think?

1010
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:04,285
Sam can't order food
or Sam can't pay a check.

1011
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:06,245
Sam can't take care of Lucy?

1012
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,956
It doesn't matter what I think.
It matters that we win.

1013
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,666
It matters what you think.

1014
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:13,794
It doesn't matter to them
what I think.

1015
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,297
It matters to me!

1016
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,176
It matters to me!

1017
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:32,063
$14.33.
That's five ones...

1018
01:01:35,399 --> 01:01:38,402
Two quarters. 14.33.

1019
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,947
Five ones and two quarters.
