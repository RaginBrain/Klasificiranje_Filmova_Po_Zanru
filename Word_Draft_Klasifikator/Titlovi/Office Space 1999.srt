Dos

00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,826
Tres

00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,203
Quatro

00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,746
Ah

7
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:39,456
Ah, ah-hoo

8
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,217
Ooh

00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:01,895
Ooh

10
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,296
Ooh

11
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,914
I got my pistol point cocked

12
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:03,999
Ring-a-ling, shots nonstop

13
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,001
Until I see
your monkey ass drop

14
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,170
And let your homies
know who done it

15
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,755
'Cause when it comes
to this gangsta shit

16
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,924
You motherfuckers
know who run it, unh-huh

17
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:14,092
We standin' up for our own shit

18
00:02:14,176 --> 00:02:16,470
And if you put
this motherfucker to the test

19
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,848
You're fuckin'
with the very best

20
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,896
I can't talk to my mother,
so I talk to my diary

21
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,194
Mother... shittin'...

22
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:33,695
son of a-

23
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,697
Ass! Ooh!

24
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,199
I just...

25
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,498
I was told-

26
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,166
Have you seen-
I was told that if...

27
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,211
I was late again I would be
summarily dismissed.

28
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,512
Mmm. No, no.

29
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,447
Just a moment.

30
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,242
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

31
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:03,577
Just a moment.

32
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,164
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

33
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,665
Just a moment.

34
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,003
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

35
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,421
Just a moment.

36
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:17,508
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

37
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:19,843
Just a moment.

38
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,929
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

39
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,098
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

40
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,268
Ahh... we have
sort of a problem here.

41
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,771
Yeah.
You apparently didn't put...

42
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:33,357
one of the new cover sheets
on your T.P.S. reports.

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,277
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that.
I- I forgot.

44
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,196
Mmm... yeah.

45
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,781
You see, we're putting
the cover sheets...

46
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:43,742
on all T.P.S. reports now
before they go out.

47
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:46,537
Did you see the memo
about this?

48
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,873
Yeah. Yeah,
I have the memo right here.

49
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,375
I just, uh, forgot...

50
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,836
but, uh, it's not shipping out
till tomorrow...

51
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,337
so there's no problem.

52
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,172
Yeah.

53
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:58,632
If you could just go ahead
and make sure...

54
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:01,927
you do that from now on,
that would be great...

55
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,804
and, uh, I'll go ahead
and make sure...

56
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,056
you get another copy
of that memo, OK?

57
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,142
No. I have the memo.
I've got it-It's right-

58
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,812
Hello, Phil. What's happening?

59
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,980
Um...

60
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:16,108
I came by here yesterday...

61
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:19,027
Four teams
out on the Spanish point...

62
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:21,280
discovered a shipwreck
off the coast...

63
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,531
Milton?

64
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:24,658
Hi. Uh...

65
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,785
could you turn that down
just a little bit?

66
00:05:26,869 --> 00:05:29,079
But I was told
that I could listen...

67
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,790
to the radio at a reasonable
volume from 9:00 to 11:00.

68
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,334
Yeah. I know you're allowed to.

69
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,838
I was just thinkin'
maybe like a personal favor.

70
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,508
Well, I-I-I told Bill
if Sandra's going to...

71
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:45,012
listen to her headphones
while she's filing...

72
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,680
then I should be able
to listen to the radio...

73
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,182
while I'm collating...

74
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:50,309
so I don't see why I should have
to turn down the radio.

75
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,476
Yeah. All right. OK.

76
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,687
I enjoy listening
at a reasonable volume...

77
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,813
Thanks.

78
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:56,273
from 9:00 to 11:00.

79
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,774
Hi, Peter.

80
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,818
What's happening?

81
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,362
We need to talk
about your T.P.S. reports.

82
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,865
Yeah. The cover sheet.
I know. I know.

83
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,033
Bill talked to me about it.

84
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:08,660
Yeah. Did you get that memo?

85
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,996
Yeah, I got the memo,
and I understand the policy...

86
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,665
and the problem is just
that I forgot the one time...

87
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,584
and I've already
taken care of it...

88
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,377
so it's not even really
a problem anymore.

89
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,255
Ah! Yeah.

90
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,840
It's just we're putting
new cover sheets...

91
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:24,343
on all the T.P.S. reports
before they go out now...

92
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:26,845
so if you could go ahead
and try to remember...

93
00:06:26,929 --> 00:06:29,515
to do that from now on,
that'd be great.

94
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:30,766
All right!

95
00:06:35,521 --> 00:06:37,356
Just a moment.

96
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,235
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

97
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:42,528
Peter Gibbons.

98
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,696
Yes.

99
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,657
Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

100
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,824
Just a moment.

101
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,326
I have the memo.

102
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:53,163
No. Not again. I-

103
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,582
Why does it say paper jam
when there is no paper jam?

104
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,584
I swear to God,
one of these days...

105
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,712
I just kick this piece of shit
out the window.

106
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,631
You and me both, man.

107
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:03,966
That thing is lucky
I'm not armed.

108
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:07,427
Piece of shit.

109
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,429
"Samir...

110
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:11,974
"Na-Na...

111
00:07:12,057 --> 00:07:13,851
"Na-Naga-"

112
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,644
- No. Thanks.
- Unh-huh!

113
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,020
Please.

114
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,190
"Michael... Bolton"?

115
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,441
That's me.

116
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,610
Wow! Is that your real name?

117
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:25,112
Yeah. Ahem.

118
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:27,948
So are you related
to that singer guy?

119
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,783
No.
It's just a coincidence.

120
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:31,034
Oh.

121
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,747
No one in this country
can pronounce my name right.

122
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,958
It's not that hard.

123
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,169
"Na-ee" and then "anajaad. "
Nayanajaad.

124
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,254
At least your name
isn't Michael Bolton.

125
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,132
You know, there's
nothing wrong with that name.

126
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,134
There was
nothing wrong with it...

127
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,969
until I was
about twelve years old...

128
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,263
and that no-talent
ass clown became famous...

129
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,472
and started winning Grammys.

130
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,640
Hmm.

131
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:57,728
Well, why don't you just go
by Mike instead of Michael?

132
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:00,105
Why should I change?
He's the one who sucks.

133
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,398
Hey, guys.

134
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,983
What's up, G?

135
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,943
Wanna go to Chotchkie's,
get some coffee?

136
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,570
Oh, it's a little early.

137
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:09,031
I gotta get outta here.
I think I'm gonna lose it.

138
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,199
Uh-oh.

139
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:13,118
Sounds like somebody's
got a case of the Mondays.

140
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,167
Boy, I tell ya, some days.

141
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,252
One of these days,
it's just gonna be like-

142
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,256
Heh heh heh!

143
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,258
So, can I get you gentlemen
something more to drink...

144
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,426
or maybe something
to nibble on-

145
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:32,054
some pizza shooters, shrimp
poppers, or extreme fajitas?

146
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:34,097
- Just coffee.
- OK!

147
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,016
Sounds like a case
of the Mondays.

148
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:44,858
What if we're still doin' this
when we're fifty?

149
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:47,569
It would be nice to have
that kind of job security.

150
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,821
Lumbergh's gonna have me work
on Saturday.

151
00:08:49,905 --> 00:08:51,823
I can tell already.

152
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,034
I'm gonna end up doin' it,
because, uh...

153
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,911
because I'm a big pussy...

154
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:58,038
which is why I work
at Initech to begin with.

155
00:08:58,121 --> 00:08:59,748
Uh, yeah, well,
I work at Initech...

156
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:01,834
and I don't consider myself
a pussy, OK?

157
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,211
Yes. I am also not a pussy.

158
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,421
They're gonna find out
the hard way I'm not a pussy...

159
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,173
if they don't start treating
their software people better.

160
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,758
That's right.

161
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,468
They don't understand.

162
00:09:11,552 --> 00:09:13,637
I could program a virus that'd
rip that place off big time.

163
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,264
Yeah.

164
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,515
Big time.

165
00:09:18,267 --> 00:09:19,518
Whoa!

166
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,727
There she is.

167
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:24,398
Peter, you know,
you always talk about this girl.

168
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,526
If you're so obsessed with her,
why don't you just ask her out?

169
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,735
Oh, I can't do that.

170
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:30,988
I'm just another
asshole customer.

171
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:33,615
You can't just walk up
to a waitress and ask her out.

172
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:35,742
Besides, I'm still trying
to work it out with Anne.

173
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:39,538
Oh, that reminds me.
I can't play poker on Friday.

174
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:40,914
Why not?

175
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:45,002
I'm gonna see this occupational
hypnotherapist with Anne.

176
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,421
Dude,
an occupational hypnotherapist?

177
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,882
I know. Anne wants me to go.

178
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:51,258
She thinks it might help.

179
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,969
Um...

180
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,430
You know,
sometimes I think that...

181
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,057
I get thinking
that she's cheating on me.

182
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,517
Yeah. I know what you mean.

183
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,102
Yeah.

184
00:10:03,353 --> 00:10:04,479
What is that supposed to mean?

185
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:06,982
Nothing.

186
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,235
Why don't you just tell Anne
that you're not into hypnosis...

187
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,403
and you wanna play poker
with us?

188
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,030
I can't do that.
She'll get all pissed off...

189
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:17,451
and, besides, I think the guy
might actually be able to help.

190
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,119
I mean,
he did help Anne lose weight.

191
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,371
Peter, she's anorexic.

192
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,248
Yeah, I know.

193
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,666
The guy's really good.

194
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,295
Yeah, well, I don't think any
occupational hypnotherapist...

195
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,088
is gonna help you solve
any of your problems.

196
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:31,882
Hey, and speaking of problems...

197
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,467
what's this I hear about you
having problems...

198
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,801
with your T.P.S. reports?

199
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:37,221
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

200
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,391
Hey! Hey, guys! Peter!

201
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,101
Is that Smykowski?

202
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:45,103
- Samir!
- What's he doing?

203
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,855
Oh, probably workin' on
another heart attack.

204
00:10:46,939 --> 00:10:48,732
I've been lookin'
all over for you guys!

205
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,527
Have you seen this?
I knew it. I knew it.

206
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,237
What?
It's a staff meeting. So what?

207
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,864
So what?
We're all screwed. That's what.

208
00:10:55,948 --> 00:10:57,574
They're gonna downsize Initech.

209
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,868
What are you talking
about? How do you know that?

210
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,120
How do I know? They're
bringing in a consultant.

211
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,288
That's how I know.

212
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,082
That's what this staff meeting's
all about.

213
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,000
It happened
at Initrode last year.

214
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,836
You have to interview
with this consultant.

215
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,629
They call them
efficiency experts...

216
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,880
but what you're really doing...

217
00:11:11,964 --> 00:11:13,298
is interviewing
for your own job.

218
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,716
Every week you say
you're gonna lose your job...

219
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,968
and you're still here.

220
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,428
Not this time. I bet
I'm the first one laid off.

221
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,639
The thought of having to go to
the state unemployment office...

222
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,766
and stand in line
with those scumbags...

223
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,226
Shit.

224
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:27,271
You know there are people
in this world...

225
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,773
that don't have to put up
with all this shit?

226
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,025
Like that guy
that invented the pet rock.

227
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,279
You see,
that's what you have to do.

228
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:38,156
You have to use your mind...

229
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,325
and come up with some really
great idea like that...

230
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:42,744
and you can make millions-
never have to work again.

231
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,955
You think the pet rock
was a really great idea?

232
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,832
Sure it was.

233
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,042
The guy made a million dollars.

234
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,423
You know, I had an idea
like that once...

235
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:55,924
a long time ago.

236
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,635
Really? What was it, Tom?

237
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,180
Well, all right.

238
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:05,225
It was
a "Jump to Conclusions" mat.

239
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:09,104
You see, it would be this mat...

240
00:12:09,188 --> 00:12:11,356
that you would
put on the floor...

241
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,652
and it would have different
conclusions written on it...

242
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:18,030
that you could jump to.

243
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,329
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

244
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:29,124
Yes. Yes, it's horrible,
this idea.

245
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,212
Uh, look...

246
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,546
I gotta get outta here.

247
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,423
I'll see you guys later...

248
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:38,467
if I still have a job.

249
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,385
Yeah.

250
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,262
Our high school
guidance counselor...

251
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,681
used to ask us what you would do
if you had a million dollars...

252
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:45,849
didn't have to work...

253
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:49,144
and whatever you'd say
was supposed to be your career.

254
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:50,687
So if you wanted
to fix old cars...

255
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,523
then you're supposed
to be an auto mechanic.

256
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,732
So what did you say?

257
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,651
I never had an answer.

258
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:58,362
I guess that's why
I'm working at Initech.

259
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,905
No. You're working at Initech...

260
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,032
'cause that question
is bullshit to begin with.

261
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,742
If everyone listened to her,
there'd be no janitors...

262
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:06,119
because no one would clean shit
if they had a million dollars.

263
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,580
You know what I would do
if I had a million dollars?

264
00:13:08,664 --> 00:13:11,834
I would invest half of it
in glorious mutual funds...

265
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,294
and then take the other half
to my friend Asadulah...

266
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:15,462
who works in securities-

267
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:17,714
Samir. Samir,
you're missing the point.

268
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,383
The point of the exercise is
you're supposed to figure out...

269
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,969
what you would want to do if-

270
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:25,973
"PC load letter"?
What the fuck does that mean?

271
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,914
Hey, Peter, man!
Check out channel nine!

272
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:52,166
Check out this chick!

273
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,668
Damn it! Lawrence,
can't you just pretend...

274
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:56,753
like we can't hear
each other through the wall?

275
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:59,089
Oh, sorry, man!
Anne over there or somethin'?

276
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:00,299
No, but...

277
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,802
If you want to talk to me,
just come over.

278
00:14:07,181 --> 00:14:10,267
Hey, man, check this out, dude.

279
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,105
The key is early detection.

280
00:14:15,189 --> 00:14:16,273
Tumors that are detected-

281
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:18,275
Aw, jeez, Lawrence.

282
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,152
Sorry, man. I thought
you'd want to see this.

283
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:22,654
Doesn't that chick
look like Anne?

284
00:14:22,738 --> 00:14:24,323
Yeah.

285
00:14:24,406 --> 00:14:25,616
A little bit. I...

286
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,492
Hey, she hasn't been over here
in a while.

287
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:28,952
You two still goin' out?

288
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,662
Yeah.

289
00:14:30,746 --> 00:14:32,247
I guess. I-I don't know.

290
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,625
Sometimes I get the feeling
like she's cheating on me.

291
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,835
Yeah. I get that feeling,
too, man.

292
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,796
What do you mean by that?

293
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,381
I don't know, man.

294
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:44,468
I just get that feeling
lookin' at her, like...

295
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,887
she's the type of chick
that just...

296
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,097
Uhh.

297
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,144
Oh, I'm sorry, man. Look, I-I-

298
00:14:54,228 --> 00:14:56,313
You know,
I'm talkin' outta my ass.

299
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,731
Forget it. Don't worry.
It's all right.

300
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,483
Just-I had a rough day.

301
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:01,235
Tell me about it, man.

302
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,736
Ohh...

303
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:05,531
Ooh, I gotta wake my ass up...

304
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:08,659
at six a. m.
every day this week...

305
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,828
drag up to Las Golindas.

306
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,705
I'm doin' the drywall up there
at the new McDonald's.

307
00:15:14,331 --> 00:15:15,499
Let me ask you something.

308
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:19,086
When you come in on Monday, and
you're not feelin' real well...

309
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:20,337
does anyone ever say to you...

310
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,881
"Sounds like someone
has a case of the Mondays"?

311
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,717
No.

312
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:27,970
No, man.

313
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,639
Shit, no, man.

314
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:33,308
You'd get your ass kicked,
sayin' something like that, man.

315
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,977
Huh.

316
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,478
We still goin' fishin'
this weekend?

317
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:38,647
Ah, Lumbergh's gonna have me
come in on Saturday.

318
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,815
I just know it.

319
00:15:39,898 --> 00:15:41,316
Well, you can
get out of that easily.

320
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,443
Yeah? How?

321
00:15:43,527 --> 00:15:44,695
Well...

322
00:15:45,404 --> 00:15:47,197
when a boss wants you
to work on Saturday...

323
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,242
he generally asks you
at the end of the day, right?

324
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,368
Yeah.

325
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,453
So all you gotta do is
avoid him-that's all right...

326
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:55,747
I got it-on the last few hours
on Friday...

327
00:15:55,831 --> 00:15:57,666
duck out early...

328
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,334
turn off
your answering machine...

329
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,086
you should be home free, man.

330
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:05,215
That's a really good idea.

331
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:07,259
Fuckin' "A," man.

332
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:12,848
Lawrence, what would you do
if you had a million dollars?

333
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:14,808
I'll tell you what I'd do, man.

334
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,145
Two chicks
at the same time, man.

335
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,067
That's it?

336
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,360
If you had a million dollars...

337
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,446
you'd do two chicks
at the same time?

338
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,282
Damn straight. I've always
wanted to do that, man.

339
00:16:30,365 --> 00:16:33,160
I think if I were a millionaire,
I could hook that up, too...

340
00:16:33,243 --> 00:16:34,953
'cause chicks dig dudes
with money.

341
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,413
Well, not all chicks.

342
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:39,249
The type of chicks that would
double up on a dude like me do.

343
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:40,459
Good point.

344
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,503
What about you, now?
What would you do?

345
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:43,962
Besides two chicks
at the same time?

346
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:45,214
Well, yeah.

347
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:46,798
Nothing.

348
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:48,967
Nothin', huh?

349
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,178
I would relax.

350
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,388
I would sit on my ass all day.

351
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:56,642
I would do nothing.

352
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:59,353
You don't need a million dollars
to do nothin', man.

353
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:00,854
Take a look at my cousin.

354
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:02,940
He's broke, don't do shit.

355
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:08,779
Corporate accounts
payable. Nina speaking.

356
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,280
Just a moment.

357
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,783
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

358
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:14,701
Just a moment.

359
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:17,037
Corporate accounts payable.
Nina speaking.

360
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,705
Just a moment.

361
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,375
So, you should ask yourself...

362
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,002
with every decision you make...

363
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,213
"Is this good for the company?

364
00:17:26,296 --> 00:17:28,006
"Am I helping with... "

365
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:29,550
Is that the guy?

366
00:17:29,633 --> 00:17:31,844
Yeah. We're screwed.

367
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:34,429
OK, then, um...

368
00:17:35,347 --> 00:17:37,933
I'd like to go ahead
and welcome, uh...

369
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,352
a new member to our team here.

370
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,770
This is, uh...

371
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,356
Bob Slydell.

372
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:47,943
Yeah. Uh...

373
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,404
Bob is a consultant.

374
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,074
Yeah. He's gonna be
sort of, uh...

375
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:56,702
helping us out...

376
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,203
a little here...

377
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,705
asking some questions...

378
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,290
maybe seeing
if there are some ways...

379
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:04,001
we can make things run
a little more smoothly...

380
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:05,252
around here.

381
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,088
Yeah.

382
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,507
Oh, and remember, next Friday...

383
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:12,926
is Hawaiian shirt day.

384
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:18,473
So, you know, if you want to,
go ahead and, uh...

385
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:20,184
wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.

386
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,062
And I said I don't care
if they lay me off, either.

387
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,314
Because I told Bill...

388
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:27,858
that if they move my desk
one more time...

389
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:30,694
then I'm-I'm quitting.
I'm going to quit...

390
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,237
and I told Dom, too...

391
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:35,532
because they've moved my desk
four times already this year...

392
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,784
and I used to be over
by the window...

393
00:18:37,868 --> 00:18:41,079
and I could see the squirrels,
and they were married...

394
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:43,332
but then they switched
from the Swingline...

395
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:45,834
to the Boston stapler, but
I kept my Swingline stapler...

396
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,878
because it didn't
bind up as much...

397
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,547
and I kept the staples
for the Swingline stapler.

398
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:51,673
OK, Milton.

399
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:53,884
No, it's not OK,
because if they make me-

400
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,387
If they take my stapler,
then I'll-I'll-I'll-

401
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,681
I'll set the building on fire.

402
00:18:59,765 --> 00:19:01,975
OK, well, that sounds great.

403
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:03,810
Uh, I'll talk to you later,
all right? Bye.

404
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,103
Peter-

405
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,246
Good-bye.

406
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,103
Come on.

407
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:50,232
Oh, for cryin'-

408
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,506
Hello, Peter. What's happening?

409
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,216
Um...

410
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,218
I'm gonna need you...

411
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:20,137
to go ahead
and come in tomorrow...

412
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,349
so if you could be here
around...

413
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,894
nine, that would be great.

414
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:28,187
OK?

415
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,899
Oh, oh, and I almost forgot.

416
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:33,734
Um...

417
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:36,570
I'm also gonna need you
to go ahead and come in...

418
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,198
on Sunday, too, OK?

419
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,908
We, um...

420
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,784
lost some people this week...

421
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:44,912
and, uh...

422
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:46,997
we need to sort of play
catch-up.

423
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,332
Thanks.

424
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:53,921
So I was sitting
in my cubicle today...

425
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:58,008
and I realized, ever since
I started working, um...

426
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:01,762
every single day of my life
has been worse than...

427
00:21:01,845 --> 00:21:03,514
the day before it.

428
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:08,185
So that means that every single
day that you see me...

429
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:11,021
that's on the worst day
of my life.

430
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:13,190
What about today?

431
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:14,525
Is today
the worst day of your life?

432
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:17,236
- Yeah.
- Wow. That's messed up.

433
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:21,657
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:22,950
Go on.

435
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,537
Is there any way
that you could sort of...

436
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:29,373
just zonk me out so that, like,
I don't know...

437
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,917
that I'm at work... in here?

438
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,418
Could I come home...

439
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:36,964
and think that I've been fishing
all day or something?

440
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:39,716
That's... really not what I do,
Peter.

441
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,093
Heh.

442
00:21:41,176 --> 00:21:42,344
However...

443
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:45,889
the good news is,
I think I can help you.

444
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:49,017
I want you to do something
for me, Peter.

445
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,896
I want you to try and relax.

446
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,403
I want you to relax
every muscle in your body...

447
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:03,782
beginning with your toes
to your fingertips.

448
00:22:06,535 --> 00:22:08,704
Now I want you
to relax your legs.

449
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,708
You're beginning to feel
your eyelids getting heavy...

450
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,044
as you slip deeper and deeper...

451
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,423
into a state
of complete relaxation.

452
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:23,677
All your cares and concerns
are disappearing.

453
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,262
Deeper and deeper.

454
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,264
Way down.

455
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,558
Your concern about your job...

456
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,561
melts away...

457
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,563
way...

458
00:22:34,646 --> 00:22:36,064
way down.

459
00:22:36,148 --> 00:22:37,524
Unh.

460
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,987
Now, when I count backwards
from three...

461
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,449
you'll be in a state
of complete relaxation.

462
00:22:45,532 --> 00:22:48,535
Your worries, cares,
and inhibitions will be gone...

463
00:22:49,328 --> 00:22:51,205
and you will remain
in that state...

464
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,708
until I snap my fingers.

465
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,251
Three.

466
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,045
Deeper and deeper.

467
00:22:58,128 --> 00:22:59,755
Way...

468
00:22:59,838 --> 00:23:01,298
way down.

469
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,300
Two.

470
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,427
Deeper and deeper...

471
00:23:05,511 --> 00:23:08,305
W- w-w-way down...

472
00:23:10,349 --> 00:23:12,768
Whu-whu-

473
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,019
One.

474
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,940
Oh, my God!
Dr. Swanson!

475
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,734
Ew... ew...

476
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,027
- Is he breathing?
- Call 911!

477
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,864
Oh! Where's the phone?
Where's the goddamn phone?!

478
00:23:25,948 --> 00:23:29,701
Dee dah dee-dee dee-dee

479
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:31,036
Yah dee dee

480
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:33,997
Dah dee-dee
dah dee-dee dah dee

481
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,208
Dee

482
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,475
Ahh...

483
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,068
Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh.

484
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,361
It's about...

485
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,154
ten o'clock.

486
00:24:06,238 --> 00:24:07,698
Yeah. Just, uh...

487
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,158
wondering where you are.

488
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:14,872
Yeah. Hi.
It's Bill Lumbergh again.

489
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:15,873
Uh...

490
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:17,541
I just wanted
to make sure you knew...

491
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:20,085
that we did start
at the, uh...

492
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,588
usual time this morning.

493
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:25,883
Yeah. It isn't a half day
or anything like that...

494
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,926
so if you could just go ahead...

495
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,012
and get here
as soon as possible...

496
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,930
that would be terrific.

497
00:24:38,437 --> 00:24:39,605
Ahh...

498
00:24:51,492 --> 00:24:53,702
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lum-

499
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:57,039
Yeah. It's-
Yeah. Hi. It's Bill Lumber-

500
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,874
Yeah. It's me again.

501
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:01,835
Uh, I was away from my desk
for a minute.

502
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,047
Just checking in.

503
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,341
Hello?

504
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:09,092
Peter, what's going on?

505
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:10,344
Huh?

506
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,846
It's three-thirty.
Why aren't you at work?

507
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,849
Because I-I-

508
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:17,351
I didn't feel like it.

509
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:19,520
Peter, what's gotten into you?

510
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,605
First, you just sit there
while Dr. Swanson dies...

511
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,525
then you walk out and embarrass
me in front of my friends...

512
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,276
and don't blame this
on hypnosis, either.

513
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,153
That's total bull-

514
00:25:34,201 --> 00:25:36,328
Listen, asshole.
Nobody hangs up on me.

515
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:37,871
We're through.

516
00:25:37,955 --> 00:25:39,873
Oh, and one more thing...

517
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:42,042
I've been cheating on you!

518
00:25:47,214 --> 00:25:49,967
So, from now on,
only use the new time sheets...

519
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:54,555
if you've worked on two or more
job codes in one day...

520
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:57,641
and you need the extra columns
to fit it all in.

521
00:25:57,724 --> 00:25:58,976
Otherwise,
use the old time sheets-

522
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,561
Where's Peter?

523
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:02,020
I heard he didn't show up
this weekend.

524
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,188
Uh, I don't know.

525
00:26:03,272 --> 00:26:04,773
...really, really help us out.

526
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:06,316
Who's that guy?

527
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,070
So, uh... any questions?

528
00:26:23,709 --> 00:26:25,210
Hi. I'm Peter.

529
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:26,378
Hi. Can I help you?

530
00:26:26,461 --> 00:26:27,588
What are you doin'
for lunch today?

531
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:31,216
Uh, well, our specials today
are blackened chicken.

532
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,552
It's actually right there
on the board. Excuse me.

533
00:26:36,722 --> 00:26:38,015
Hey, look who's back!

534
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:39,850
Table for three to-

535
00:26:42,686 --> 00:26:44,605
I was askin'
what you were doin' for lunch.

536
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:46,315
Would you like to have lunch
with me?

537
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,109
Are you-are you serious?

538
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,360
Yeah.

539
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:54,615
Yeah. I-I don't think
I'm supposed to do that.

540
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,659
Oh. OK, well,
I'll tell you what I'll do.

541
00:26:57,743 --> 00:26:59,161
I'm gonna go next door
and get a table...

542
00:26:59,244 --> 00:27:00,871
and if you'd like
to join me, uh...

543
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,164
no big deal, all right?

544
00:27:02,247 --> 00:27:04,124
And if not, that's cool, too.

545
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,417
- OK?
- OK.

546
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:06,668
All right.

547
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:08,754
When you say,
"next door... "

548
00:27:08,837 --> 00:27:11,340
do you mean
Chili's or Flinger's?

549
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:13,050
Flinger's.

550
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,301
OK.

551
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:17,804
What you do at Initech...

552
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,682
is you take the specifications
from the customers...

553
00:27:20,766 --> 00:27:23,185
and you bring them down
to the software engineers?

554
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,521
Yes. Y-yes.
That's-that's right.

555
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,231
Well, then I just have to ask...

556
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:28,524
why couldn't the customers...

557
00:27:28,607 --> 00:27:32,152
just take them directly
to the software people, huh?

558
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,238
Well, I'll tell you why.

559
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:37,199
Uh, because...

560
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:40,536
engineers are not good
at dealing with customers.

561
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:42,287
Uh-huh. So...

562
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:48,001
you physically take the specs
from the customer?

563
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,170
Well...

564
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,716
no. My secretary does that
or the fax.

565
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,510
Huh.

566
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,303
So then you must
physically bring them...

567
00:27:58,387 --> 00:27:59,429
to the software people.

568
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:00,597
Well...

569
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,058
no.

570
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,393
I mean...

571
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:05,978
sometimes.

572
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:10,315
What-what would you
say you do here?

573
00:28:11,441 --> 00:28:13,485
Well, look,
I already told you.

574
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,821
I deal with
the goddamn customers...

575
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,739
so the engineers don't have to.

576
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:19,825
I have people skills.

577
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,910
I am good at dealing
with people!

578
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,328
Can't you understand that?!

579
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:25,873
What the hell is wrong
with you people?!

580
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:27,166
I-

581
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,923
Let's see...

582
00:28:35,007 --> 00:28:37,176
you are...

583
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:38,552
Michael...

584
00:28:40,012 --> 00:28:42,681
- Bolton?
- Yeah.

585
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:45,267
Is that your real name?

586
00:28:46,018 --> 00:28:47,186
Yeah.

587
00:28:49,229 --> 00:28:51,273
Are you any relation
to the pop singer?

588
00:28:51,356 --> 00:28:53,358
No, it's-it's
just a coincidence.

589
00:28:53,442 --> 00:28:54,985
Ha ha.
To be honest with you...

590
00:28:55,068 --> 00:28:56,695
I love his music. I do.

591
00:28:56,778 --> 00:28:58,947
- I'm a Michael Bolton fan.
- Me, too.

592
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:00,657
For my money, I don't
know if it gets any better...

593
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,160
than when he sings
"When a Man Loves a Woman. "

594
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:05,162
But you must really
love his music, huh?

595
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:09,374
Yeah, he's-he's...

596
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:11,168
he's pretty-
he's pretty good, I guess.

597
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,836
You're goddamn right, he is.

598
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,380
Right.

599
00:29:15,464 --> 00:29:17,925
So tell me, what's
your favorite song of his?

600
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,260
Mmm...

601
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:25,015
I don't-I don't know.
Heh heh.

602
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,434
I mean, I guess I sort
of like them all.

603
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:30,646
That's a riot.
I'm the exact same way.

604
00:29:30,729 --> 00:29:31,980
But it must be twice
as hard for you...

605
00:29:32,064 --> 00:29:33,482
being you have
the same name as him.

606
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:36,443
I celebrate
the guy's entire catalog.

607
00:29:36,527 --> 00:29:39,029
Anyway, let's get down
to business, Michael.

608
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,281
You know,
you can just call me Mike.

609
00:29:46,745 --> 00:29:47,830
Hi.

610
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:49,206
Hey.

611
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:54,044
I wonder if I'm allowed
to, uh, wear this in here?

612
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:56,213
I think it would be OK.

613
00:29:57,881 --> 00:29:58,966
Would you like to sit down?

614
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:00,259
OK.

615
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,594
Ahh.

616
00:30:04,096 --> 00:30:05,222
Wow!

617
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:08,058
This place is really... nice.

618
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,435
Yeah. Is it?

619
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,729
Yeah, my God,
compared to Chotchkie's!

620
00:30:12,813 --> 00:30:15,107
I like the uniforms better,
anyways.

621
00:30:15,983 --> 00:30:17,067
I like yours.

622
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:18,318
Ugh!

623
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:23,157
"We're not in Kansas anymore. "

624
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,284
Yeah.

625
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,744
Really. Ha ha.

626
00:30:27,828 --> 00:30:29,246
It's on your...

627
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,749
Ohh! Yeah. That's...

628
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:34,751
That's, uh...

629
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:37,796
That's one of my-
my pieces of flair.

630
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,964
What's a "piece of flair"?

631
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,049
Oh, it's, uh, where, you know...

632
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:44,678
like these suspenders and, uh,
buttons, they're all sort of...

633
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,805
We're actually required
to wear...

634
00:30:46,889 --> 00:30:49,850
um, fifteen pieces of flair.

635
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,102
It's really stupid, actually.

636
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:53,395
Do you get to pick 'em
yourself?

637
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:54,938
Yeah, yeah, we do.

638
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:56,148
Although I didn't actually
choose these.

639
00:30:56,231 --> 00:31:00,527
I just sort of grabbed,
you know, fifteen buttons.

640
00:31:00,611 --> 00:31:03,280
I don't even know what they say.
I don't really care.

641
00:31:03,989 --> 00:31:05,574
I don't really like
talking about my flair.

642
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:07,075
OK.

643
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:10,120
So, where do you, work, Peter?

644
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,705
Initech.

645
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,582
And-Yeah?
What-what do you do there?

646
00:31:14,708 --> 00:31:16,418
I sit in a cubicle...

647
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:19,463
and I update bank software
for the 2000 switch.

648
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,007
What's that?

649
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,259
Well, see, they wrote
all this bank software...

650
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:26,261
and, uh, to save space...

651
00:31:26,345 --> 00:31:28,096
they used two digits
for the date instead of four.

652
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,099
So like 98 instead of 1998.

653
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:34,353
Uh, so I go through these
thousands of lines of code...

654
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:37,231
and, uh...
It doesn't really matter.

655
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:40,192
I, uh, I don't like my job,
and, uh...

656
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,569
I don't think I'm gonna go
anymore.

657
00:31:43,821 --> 00:31:45,072
You're just not gonna go?

658
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:46,323
Yeah.

659
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:47,574
Won't you get fired?

660
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:49,701
I don't know.

661
00:31:49,785 --> 00:31:53,580
But I really don't like it,
and, uh, I'm not gonna go.

662
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:55,833
So you're gonna quit?

663
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:59,044
Nah-uh. Not really. Uh...

664
00:31:59,127 --> 00:32:00,712
I'm just gonna stop going.

665
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,049
What?

666
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:06,176
Uh, when did you decide
all that?

667
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,344
About an hour ago.

668
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:08,846
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

669
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:10,097
An hour ago.

670
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,975
So you're gonna get another job?

671
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:15,185
I don't think I'd like
another job.

672
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:19,147
Well, what are you going to do
about money and bills and-

673
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:21,733
You know, I've never
really liked paying bills.

674
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,277
I don't think
I'm gonna do that, either.

675
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:26,488
Ahh...

676
00:32:26,572 --> 00:32:28,657
well, so what do you want to do?

677
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,701
I want to take you
out to dinner...

678
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:33,078
and then I want to go back to my
apartment and watch "Kung Fu. "

679
00:32:33,162 --> 00:32:34,454
Do you ever watch "Kung Fu"?

680
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:38,333
I love "Kung Fu. "

681
00:32:38,417 --> 00:32:40,669
- Channel 39.
- Totally.

682
00:32:40,752 --> 00:32:42,504
You should come over
and watch "Kung Fu" tonight.

683
00:32:42,588 --> 00:32:44,506
- OK.
- Great.

684
00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:46,758
OK. Can we order lunch first?

685
00:32:46,842 --> 00:32:48,385
- Yeah.
- OK.

686
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:06,069
Took a stapler off my desk...

687
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:15,370
Anyway, sounds great, Bob.
See you in a few.

688
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,584
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

689
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:22,169
Nothing.

690
00:33:22,252 --> 00:33:24,171
I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead...

691
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:26,507
and move your desk
again, so...

692
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,343
if you could go ahead
and get it as far back...

693
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,261
against that wall as possible...

694
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:32,596
that would be great.

695
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,181
No, because I was-

696
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:35,724
That way,
we'll have some room...

697
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:37,601
for some of these boxes
and things...

698
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,812
we need to put in here,
and, uh...

699
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:44,316
Oh. Oh, there it is.

700
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,110
Here, let me just go ahead
and get that from you.

701
00:33:49,238 --> 00:33:50,531
Great.

702
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:54,952
So if you could just get to that
as soon as possible...

703
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,788
that would be terrific, OK?

704
00:33:57,871 --> 00:34:00,582
Thanks a bunch, Milton.
Good-bye.

705
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:02,876
OK.

706
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:06,338
I could set the building
on fire.

707
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,593
- Peter.
- Michael.

708
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:12,761
What the hell's going on, man?

709
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:14,638
I thought you'd come in here
and start shooting.

710
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:16,807
No. I just came to get
my address book.

711
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,016
I'm not gonna stay.

712
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,394
I got a phone number,
Mike, that I don't wanna lose.

713
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,187
What?
Peter, you're in deep shit.

714
00:34:22,271 --> 00:34:24,273
You were supposed to come in
Saturday. What were you doing?

715
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,943
Michael, I did nothing.

716
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:29,486
I did absolutely nothing...

717
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,489
and it was everything
that I thought it could be.

718
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:35,200
I hope you have
a better story for Lumbergh.

719
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:37,828
You're supposed to be at your
interview with the consultants.

720
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:39,079
The who?

721
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:41,498
The consultants.
What has gotten into you?

722
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,712
Oh, yeah... right.

723
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:50,507
Wait, Peter.
You gotta postpone it, man.

724
00:34:50,591 --> 00:34:51,633
Tell 'em you've been sick.
Make something up.

725
00:34:51,717 --> 00:34:53,886
Oh, no way. No, I feel great.

726
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:55,804
It's the best day of my life.

727
00:34:58,056 --> 00:35:00,392
Next batter
looks like a Peter Gibbons.

728
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:01,602
Uh-huh.

729
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,896
Ah, there you are.
We were just talking about you.

730
00:35:03,979 --> 00:35:05,606
You must be Peter Gibbons.

731
00:35:05,689 --> 00:35:07,024
Uh-huh. Terrific.

732
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:09,484
I'm Bob Slydell. This is
my associate Bob Porter.

733
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:11,028
Oh, hi, Bob. Bob.

734
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:13,614
Grab a seat
and join us for a minute or two.

735
00:35:15,157 --> 00:35:16,867
You see, what we're
actually trying to do here...

736
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:19,870
is we're just,
we're trying to get a feel...

737
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:21,830
for how people spend their day
at work.

738
00:35:21,914 --> 00:35:23,582
So if you would...

739
00:35:23,665 --> 00:35:27,252
would you walk us through
a typical day for you?

740
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,672
- Yeah.
- Great.

741
00:35:30,756 --> 00:35:34,218
Well, I generally come in
at least fifteen minutes late.

742
00:35:34,301 --> 00:35:36,720
Uh, I use the side door.

743
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,765
That way Lumbergh can't see me.

744
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:43,769
And after that, I just sort of
space out for about an hour.

745
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:46,355
Uh, "space out"?

746
00:35:46,438 --> 00:35:47,523
Yeah.

747
00:35:47,606 --> 00:35:49,441
I just stare at my desk.

748
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:50,984
But it looks like I'm working.

749
00:35:51,068 --> 00:35:54,863
I do that for probably
another hour after lunch, too.

750
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,740
I'd say in a given week...

751
00:35:56,824 --> 00:35:58,659
I probably only do
about fifteen minutes...

752
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:01,620
of real, actual work.

753
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,333
Peter,
would you be a good sport...

754
00:36:06,416 --> 00:36:08,377
and indulge us and just...

755
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,461
tell us a little more?

756
00:36:09,545 --> 00:36:11,046
Oh, yeah.

757
00:36:11,129 --> 00:36:14,758
Let me tell you something
about T.P.S. reports.

758
00:36:14,842 --> 00:36:15,968
Ahh...

759
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:19,429
The thing is, Bob,
it's not that I'm lazy.

760
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:21,515
It's that I just don't care.

761
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,767
Don't... don't care?

762
00:36:23,851 --> 00:36:26,353
It's a problem of motivation,
all right?

763
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:28,021
Now, if I work my ass off...

764
00:36:28,105 --> 00:36:29,940
and Initech
ships a few extra units...

765
00:36:30,023 --> 00:36:31,859
I don't see another dime.

766
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,527
So where's the motivation?

767
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,196
And here's something else,
Bob...

768
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,198
I have eight different bosses
right now.

769
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:39,366
- I beg your pardon?
- Eight bosses.

770
00:36:39,449 --> 00:36:40,534
- Eight?
- Eight, Bob.

771
00:36:40,617 --> 00:36:43,328
So that means that
when I make a mistake...

772
00:36:43,412 --> 00:36:47,040
I have eight different people
coming by to tell me about it.

773
00:36:47,124 --> 00:36:50,419
That's my only real motivation,
is not to be hassled.

774
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:51,712
That and the fear
of losing my job.

775
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,630
But you know, Bob...

776
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:55,340
that'll only make someone
work just hard enough...

777
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,592
not to get fired.

778
00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:00,220
Would you bear with me
for just a second, please?

779
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:01,597
OK.

780
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:04,558
What if-
and believe me...

781
00:37:04,641 --> 00:37:07,603
this is strictly hypothetical-

782
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:11,690
but what if you were offered
some kind of a stock option...

783
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:13,442
equity-sharing program?

784
00:37:13,525 --> 00:37:14,818
Would that do anything for you?

785
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:17,112
I don't know. I guess.
Listen, I'm gonna go.

786
00:37:17,196 --> 00:37:20,157
Uh, it's been really nice
talking to both of you guys.

787
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,492
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

788
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:24,161
Pleasure's all on this
side of the table, trust me.

789
00:37:24,244 --> 00:37:25,787
Good luck
with your layoffs, all right?

790
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:27,623
I hope your firings
go really well.

791
00:37:27,706 --> 00:37:28,874
- OK.
- Thanks a lot.

792
00:37:28,957 --> 00:37:30,709
Great. Wow.

793
00:37:38,342 --> 00:37:40,677
So, Peter, what's happening?

794
00:37:40,761 --> 00:37:42,137
Listen, uh...

795
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,855
Joanna, would you
come here a minute, please?

796
00:37:51,939 --> 00:37:53,815
Yeah.

797
00:37:53,899 --> 00:37:58,070
I'm sorry I was late, but I
was having lunch, and I, uh...

798
00:37:58,153 --> 00:37:59,738
We need to talk about
your flair.

799
00:38:00,656 --> 00:38:03,450
Really?
I- I have fifteen pieces on.

800
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:04,993
I also...

801
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:08,247
Well, fifteen
is the minimum, OK?

802
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,414
Oh. OK.

803
00:38:09,498 --> 00:38:11,416
Now, you know,
it's up to you whether or not...

804
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,378
you want to just
do the bare minimum or...

805
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,629
Well, like Brian, for example...

806
00:38:15,712 --> 00:38:19,091
has thirty-seven pieces of flair
on today.

807
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:20,509
And a terrific smile.

808
00:38:20,592 --> 00:38:22,886
OK, so you want me to wear more?

809
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:25,597
Look, Joanna...

810
00:38:25,681 --> 00:38:26,765
Yeah?

811
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:28,684
People can get
a cheeseburger anywhere, OK?

812
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:31,895
They come to Chotchkie's for
the atmosphere and the attitude.

813
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,022
OK? that's what
the flair's about.

814
00:38:34,106 --> 00:38:35,732
- It's about fun.
- Yeah.

815
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:37,985
OK, so more then, yeah?

816
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:42,948
Look, we want you
to express yourself, OK?

817
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:47,452
Now if you feel that the bare
minimum is enough, then, OK...

818
00:38:47,536 --> 00:38:50,372
but some people choose
to wear more...

819
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,291
and we encourage that, OK?

820
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:55,627
You do want to express yourself,
don't you?

821
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:57,838
Y- yeah.

822
00:38:57,921 --> 00:39:00,340
OK, great, great.
That's all I ask.

823
00:39:00,424 --> 00:39:01,967
OK.

824
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:05,846
Right, so there's
three more people...

825
00:39:05,929 --> 00:39:07,931
we can easily lose.

826
00:39:08,015 --> 00:39:11,226
Then there's Tom Smykowski.

827
00:39:12,144 --> 00:39:13,228
He's useless.

828
00:39:13,312 --> 00:39:14,855
Gone.

829
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:16,523
Sounds good to me.

830
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,942
Here's a peculiar...

831
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:21,320
- Uh, Milton Waddams.
- Who's he?

832
00:39:21,403 --> 00:39:23,405
You know, squirrelly
looking guy. Mumbles a lot.

833
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:24,573
Oh, yeah.

834
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,283
We-we can't actually
find a record...

835
00:39:26,366 --> 00:39:28,660
of him being
a current employee here.

836
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,579
I looked into it
more deeply...

837
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:32,581
and I found that
apparently what happened...

838
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:35,375
is that he was laid off
five years ago...

839
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:36,585
and no one ever
told him about it...

840
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:39,129
but through some kind of glitch
in the payroll department...

841
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:40,547
he still gets a paycheck.

842
00:39:40,631 --> 00:39:43,425
So we just went ahead
and fixed the glitch.

843
00:39:43,509 --> 00:39:44,593
Great.

844
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,387
So, uh, Milton has been let go?

845
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:48,555
Just a second there,
professor.

846
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,184
We, uh, we fixed the glitch.

847
00:39:52,267 --> 00:39:54,394
So he won't be receiving
a paycheck anymore.

848
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:56,939
So it'll just work itself out
naturally.

849
00:39:57,022 --> 00:40:00,067
We always like to avoid
confrontation whenever possible.

850
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,235
The problem is solved
from your end.

851
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:05,948
I'd like to move us
right along to a Peter Gibbons.

852
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:08,575
Now, we had a chance
to meet this young man...

853
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,245
and, boy, that's just
a straight shooter...

854
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:13,038
with upper management
written all over him.

855
00:40:13,121 --> 00:40:15,499
Eech. Ooh.

856
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:18,836
Yeah. Um...

857
00:40:18,919 --> 00:40:20,170
I'm going to have to go ahead...

858
00:40:20,254 --> 00:40:22,422
and sort of disagree
with you there.

859
00:40:22,506 --> 00:40:25,050
Yeah, uh, he's been
real flaky lately...

860
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:28,887
and I'm just not sure
that he's the caliber person...

861
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:31,223
that we would want
for upper management.

862
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:33,976
He's also been having
some problems...

863
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:35,936
with his T.P.S. reports.

864
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:38,939
I'll handle this.

865
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:42,067
We feel...

866
00:40:42,151 --> 00:40:44,236
that the problem
isn't with Peter.

867
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,071
Mm-mmm.

868
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:48,240
It's that you haven't
challenged him enough...

869
00:40:48,323 --> 00:40:49,408
to get him really motivated.

870
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:50,659
There it is.

871
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,580
Yeah... Ah, well...

872
00:40:54,663 --> 00:40:56,915
I'm just not sure about that
right now.

873
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:59,710
Yeah, Bill, let me ask
you a real quick question here.

874
00:40:59,793 --> 00:41:03,005
How much time would you say
you spend each week...

875
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:05,090
dealing with
these T.P.S. reports?

876
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:11,471
Yeah...

877
00:41:20,022 --> 00:41:22,482
Damn,
it feels good to be a gangsta

878
00:41:32,951 --> 00:41:34,745
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

879
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,414
A real gangsta ass nigger
plays his cards right

880
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:40,042
A real gangsta ass nigger
never runs his mouth

881
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:43,128
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers don't start fights

882
00:41:43,212 --> 00:41:45,672
And niggers always
gotta hide here

883
00:41:45,756 --> 00:41:48,550
Showin' all his boys
how we shot 'em

884
00:41:48,634 --> 00:41:50,844
Real gangsta ass niggers
don't flex nuts

885
00:41:50,928 --> 00:41:53,597
'Cause real gangsta ass
niggers know they got 'em

886
00:41:54,348 --> 00:41:56,642
And everything is cool
in the mind of a gangsta

887
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:59,102
'Cause gangsta ass niggers
think deep

888
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:01,980
Up three-sixty-five
and twenty-four-seven

889
00:42:02,064 --> 00:42:04,566
Real gangsta ass niggers
don't sleep

890
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:07,611
And all I gotta say
to you wannabe, gonna-be

891
00:42:07,694 --> 00:42:10,155
cootchie-eatin',
jealous-hearted pranksters...

892
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:16,036
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

893
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:20,123
Hey, Peter, man!

894
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:23,710
Check out channel nine.
It's the breast exams. Whoo!

895
00:42:37,558 --> 00:42:39,518
Damn,
it feels good to be a gangsta

896
00:42:39,601 --> 00:42:40,853
Hi, Peter.

897
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,688
Oh, hi, Dom.

898
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:45,232
Although I was born in Jamaica

899
00:42:45,315 --> 00:42:47,985
Now I'm in the U.S. making deals

900
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:50,696
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

901
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:53,031
I mean,
one that you don't really know

902
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,993
Riding around town
in a drop top Benz

903
00:42:56,076 --> 00:42:58,996
Hittin' switches
in my black six-four

904
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:01,790
Now gangsta ass niggers
come in all shapes and colors

905
00:43:01,874 --> 00:43:04,209
Some got killed in the past

906
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:06,879
But this gangsta here
was a smart one

907
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:08,881
Started living for the Lord
and not laughs

908
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:12,634
Now all I gotta say
to you wannabe, gonna-be

909
00:43:12,718 --> 00:43:14,928
crumb snatchin',
cootchie-eatin' pranksters

910
00:43:15,012 --> 00:43:16,555
When the Grim Reaper steps up

911
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:18,015
What the hell you gonna do?

912
00:43:18,098 --> 00:43:20,267
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta

913
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:32,946
So... Peter...

914
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:34,114
what's happening?

915
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:37,493
Ahh, now,
are you going to go ahead...

916
00:43:37,576 --> 00:43:41,455
and have those T.P.S. reports
for us this afternoon?

917
00:43:41,538 --> 00:43:42,915
No.

918
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,668
Ahh... yeah...

919
00:43:46,752 --> 00:43:48,629
So I guess we should
probably go ahead...

920
00:43:48,712 --> 00:43:51,590
and have a little talk, hmm?

921
00:43:51,673 --> 00:43:54,676
Not right now, Lumbergh,
I'm-I'm kinda busy.

922
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,597
In fact, I'm going to have
to ask you to go ahead.

923
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:00,682
Just come back another time.

924
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:03,143
I got a meeting with the Bobs
in a couple of minutes.

925
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:06,355
Uh, I wasn't aware
of a meeting with them.

926
00:44:06,438 --> 00:44:08,607
Yeah, they called me at home.

927
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:14,530
That sounds good, Peter.

928
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:16,782
And, uh, we'll go ahead and...

929
00:44:16,865 --> 00:44:19,117
get this all fixed up for you.

930
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,285
Great.

931
00:44:25,332 --> 00:44:28,043
Hi, Milton. What's happening?

932
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:31,630
I- I didn't receive
my paycheck this week.

933
00:44:31,713 --> 00:44:36,301
Uh, you're going to have to talk
to payroll about that.

934
00:44:36,385 --> 00:44:37,636
I did and they said-

935
00:44:37,719 --> 00:44:39,555
Milt, we're gonna go ahead...

936
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:43,350
and move you downstairs
into storage "B."

937
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:45,102
No, I-I...

938
00:44:45,185 --> 00:44:49,147
New people are coming,
and we need the space.

939
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:50,524
But there's no space-

940
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:54,153
So if you could go ahead
and pack your stuff...

941
00:44:54,236 --> 00:44:55,946
and move it down there...

942
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:57,990
that would be terrific.

943
00:44:58,073 --> 00:44:59,408
OK?

944
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:01,493
Uh, excuse me...

945
00:45:01,577 --> 00:45:07,124
I believe you have my stapler,
please. Hmm.

946
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:09,459
You've been missing
a lot of work lately.

947
00:45:09,543 --> 00:45:11,712
I wouldn't say
I've been missing it, Bob.

948
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:14,423
Good one.

949
00:45:14,506 --> 00:45:16,300
Oh, that's terrific, Peter.

950
00:45:16,383 --> 00:45:19,511
I'm sure you've-you've heard
some of the rumors...

951
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:21,305
circulating
around the hallways...

952
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:24,183
about how we're going to do
a little "housecleaning... "

953
00:45:24,266 --> 00:45:25,475
with some software people.

954
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,729
Well, Bob, I have heard that.
You gotta do what you gotta do.

955
00:45:28,812 --> 00:45:30,814
We'll be getting rid
of these people.

956
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:35,694
First, Mr. Samir Naga...

957
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:36,945
Naga...

958
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:40,240
Naga-gonna work here
anymore, anyway.

959
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:43,744
And Mr. Mike Bolton.
Nobody's gonna miss him.

960
00:45:43,827 --> 00:45:45,496
You're gonna layoff
Samir and Michael?

961
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:48,081
Yeah. We're gonna bring
in some entry-level graduates.

962
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,334
Farm some work out to Singapore,
that's the usual deal.

963
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:51,668
It's standard
operating procedure.

964
00:45:51,752 --> 00:45:53,921
Do they know this yet?

965
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:56,173
No. No, of course not.

966
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:59,051
We find it's always better
to fire people on a Friday.

967
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:01,345
Studies have
statistically shown...

968
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,013
there's less chance
of an incident...

969
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:04,765
if you do it at the end
of the week.

970
00:46:04,848 --> 00:46:07,976
Peter, what we'd like to do
is put you into position...

971
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:11,730
to have as many
as four people...

972
00:46:11,813 --> 00:46:13,065
working right underneath you.

973
00:46:13,148 --> 00:46:15,275
This is a big promotion, Pete.

974
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:18,028
So you're going
to fire Michael and Samir...

975
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:19,905
and give me more money?

976
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:23,575
Uh-huh.

977
00:46:23,659 --> 00:46:25,911
Wow!

978
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:28,914
Hmm. Yeah.

979
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:31,792
That's it.
That's exactly what I need.

980
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,168
Give it to me.

981
00:46:33,252 --> 00:46:34,711
Come on, you little fucker,
let's go.

982
00:46:34,795 --> 00:46:36,338
That's what I need.
Let's do that.

983
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:38,924
Let's do exactly that,
you little fuck-

984
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:40,843
- Michael.
- Hey.

985
00:46:40,926 --> 00:46:42,302
Listen to me.

986
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,390
What are you doing tonight?

987
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:50,811
Michael, there comes
a point in a man's life...

988
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:53,438
and maybe that time for you
is now...

989
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:58,193
when it doesn't hurt to start
thinking about the future.

990
00:46:58,277 --> 00:47:00,320
Uh, no offense there, Peter...

991
00:47:00,404 --> 00:47:02,072
but speak for yourself there,
sport.

992
00:47:02,156 --> 00:47:05,409
I'm not the one who's been
flakin' out at work.

993
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:09,496
I know you had this religious
experience or whatever...

994
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,332
but get your shit together,
or you're gonna get canned.

995
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:15,836
Yeah, and, uh, and I-Listen...

996
00:47:16,837 --> 00:47:18,630
That virus
you're always talking about...

997
00:47:18,714 --> 00:47:20,841
the one that could
rip off the company...

998
00:47:20,924 --> 00:47:22,342
for a bunch of money.

999
00:47:22,426 --> 00:47:23,677
Yeah, what about it?

1000
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,429
Well, how does it work?

1001
00:47:26,221 --> 00:47:27,598
It's pretty brilliant.

1002
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,766
What it does is every time
there's a bank transaction...

1003
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:32,311
where interest is computed-
there are thousands a day-

1004
00:47:32,394 --> 00:47:34,354
the computer ends up with
these fractions of a cent...

1005
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:35,939
which it usually rounds off.

1006
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:38,358
What this does is it takes
those little remainders...

1007
00:47:38,442 --> 00:47:40,360
and puts it into an account.

1008
00:47:40,444 --> 00:47:43,113
- This sounds familiar.
- They did it in "Superman Ill. "

1009
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:44,364
Right, uh...

1010
00:47:44,448 --> 00:47:46,116
An underrated movie, actually.

1011
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:49,578
There were hackers that did it
in the seventies as well.

1012
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:52,664
- So they check for this now.
- No, here's the thing.

1013
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:56,001
Initech's so backed up with all
the software we're updating...

1014
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:57,211
they'd never notice.

1015
00:47:57,294 --> 00:47:59,296
You're right.

1016
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:01,715
Even if they wanted to, they
couldn't check all that code.

1017
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:04,718
Thumbs up their asses.
Thumbs up their asses.

1018
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:08,722
So, Michael, what's
to stop you from doing this?

1019
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:11,350
It's not worth the risk.
I got a good job.

1020
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,062
What if you didn't have
a good job?

1021
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,731
Cock gobblers!

1022
00:48:21,401 --> 00:48:25,113
Samir and I are
the best programmers they got.

1023
00:48:25,197 --> 00:48:27,366
You haven't been showin' up,
and you get to keep your job.

1024
00:48:27,449 --> 00:48:29,284
Actually, I'm being promoted.

1025
00:48:29,368 --> 00:48:31,995
- What?!
- I know, Michael.

1026
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,581
It's completely unfair.

1027
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:37,167
And I realized something today.

1028
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:40,170
It's not just about me
and my dream of doing nothing.

1029
00:48:40,254 --> 00:48:42,214
It's about all of us together.

1030
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:47,219
I don't know what happened to me
at that hypnotherapist.

1031
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:49,805
Maybe it was just shock,
and it's wearing off now...

1032
00:48:49,888 --> 00:48:52,558
but when I saw that fat man
keel over and die...

1033
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:55,602
Michael, we don't have
a lot of time on this earth.

1034
00:48:55,686 --> 00:48:58,605
We weren't meant to spend it
this way.

1035
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:01,900
Human beings were not meant
to sit in little cubicles...

1036
00:49:01,984 --> 00:49:03,902
staring at computer screens
all day...

1037
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:05,112
filling out useless forms...

1038
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:06,822
and listening
to eight different bosses...

1039
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:09,366
drone on
about mission statements.

1040
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:12,327
I told those fudgepackers
I liked Michael Bolton's music.

1041
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:16,081
Ohh. That is not right, Michael.

1042
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:19,001
For five years now,
you've worked your ass off...

1043
00:49:19,084 --> 00:49:23,130
hoping for a promotion,
profit sharing, or something.

1044
00:49:23,213 --> 00:49:24,590
Five years...

1045
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:27,426
of your mid-twenties now gone.

1046
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:28,760
And you're gonna
go in tomorrow...

1047
00:49:28,844 --> 00:49:31,471
they're gonna throw you
out on the street.

1048
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,307
You know why?

1049
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,769
So Bill Lumbergh's stock
will go up a quarter of a point.

1050
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,480
Ugh.

1051
00:49:39,563 --> 00:49:41,648
Michael, let's make
that stock go down...

1052
00:49:41,732 --> 00:49:43,692
and let's take enough money
out of that place...

1053
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:47,070
so that we never have
to sit in a cubicle ever again.

1054
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:50,449
Your software works, right?

1055
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:52,242
Of course it works.
That's not the point.

1056
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,746
Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't
know how to install it.

1057
00:49:55,829 --> 00:49:58,373
I don't know the credit union's
software well enough. OK?

1058
00:49:58,457 --> 00:50:02,169
Yeah. But Samir does.

1059
00:50:02,294 --> 00:50:03,629
But that's not much money.

1060
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:04,922
That's the beauty of it.

1061
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:09,051
Each withdrawal, it's a fraction
of a cent, too small to notice.

1062
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:11,345
But you take a few thousand
withdrawals a day...

1063
00:50:11,428 --> 00:50:12,846
you space it out
over a couple of years...

1064
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,182
that's a few
hundred thousand dollars.

1065
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:16,475
It's like "Superman Ill. "

1066
00:50:16,558 --> 00:50:18,602
"Superman Ill"?

1067
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:22,356
I have to leave now.
I have to get my rsum ready.

1068
00:50:22,439 --> 00:50:26,652
For another job where
they can fire you for no reason?

1069
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:29,404
That's right. If I'm lucky.

1070
00:50:29,488 --> 00:50:33,617
I'm tired of being
pushed around. Aren't you?

1071
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,453
Yes, but I'm not going to do
anything illegal.

1072
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:38,956
Illegal?
Samir, this is America.

1073
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,083
Come on. Sit down.

1074
00:50:42,042 --> 00:50:44,253
Come on. This isn't Riyadh.

1075
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:47,256
They're not going
to saw your hands off here.

1076
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:49,716
The worst they'd do is put you
for a couple of months...

1077
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,136
into a white-collar,
minimum-security resort.

1078
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:56,890
Shit, we should be so lucky.
They have conjugal visits there.

1079
00:50:56,974 --> 00:50:58,600
- Really?
- Yes.

1080
00:50:58,684 --> 00:50:59,977
Shit!

1081
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:02,771
I'm a free man. I haven't had
a conjugal visit in six months.

1082
00:51:02,855 --> 00:51:04,606
So what do you think?

1083
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,192
This thing is actually
pretty fail-safe, Samir.

1084
00:51:07,276 --> 00:51:08,443
Samir?

1085
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:12,948
You came here looking
for a land of opportunity.

1086
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:16,160
And this is the knock
of that opportunity.

1087
00:51:16,243 --> 00:51:18,579
Tomorrow is your last day
at Initech.

1088
00:51:18,662 --> 00:51:20,164
You have two options-

1089
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:22,666
unemployment
or early retirement.

1090
00:51:22,749 --> 00:51:24,293
What's it gonna be?

1091
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:26,712
- I have a question.
- Yes?

1092
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:30,507
In this conjugal visits,
you can have sex with women?

1093
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:33,260
Yep, you sure can.

1094
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:38,015
OK, I'll do it.

1095
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:40,976
That's what I'm talkin'
about when I talk about America!

1096
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:42,394
Can we discuss the plan?

1097
00:51:42,477 --> 00:51:44,188
OK, yeah, good, right.

1098
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:45,731
It works like a computer virus.

1099
00:51:45,814 --> 00:51:48,400
All we do is load it into
the credit union's mainframe.

1100
00:51:48,484 --> 00:51:49,651
It'll do the rest.

1101
00:51:49,735 --> 00:51:52,070
Get me that disk,
and I'll take it from there.

1102
00:51:52,154 --> 00:51:54,990
Before we go any further,
all right?

1103
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:57,534
We have to swear to God,
Allah...

1104
00:51:57,618 --> 00:52:00,120
that nobody knows about this
but us, all right?

1105
00:52:00,204 --> 00:52:03,248
No family members,
no girlfriends. Nobody.

1106
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:04,541
- Of course.
- Agreed.

1107
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:06,793
Don't worry, man!
I won't tell anyone, either.

1108
00:52:06,877 --> 00:52:09,046
- What the fuck is that?
- Don't worry. He's cool.

1109
00:52:09,129 --> 00:52:12,549
All right. Here's how
I see it all going down.

1110
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:15,469
Peter, congratulations.
This is one heck of a promotion.

1111
00:52:15,552 --> 00:52:16,762
Thank you, Bob.

1112
00:52:16,845 --> 00:52:19,097
We'll get some people
under you right away.

1113
00:52:25,604 --> 00:52:26,772
I got something for your mind

1114
00:52:26,855 --> 00:52:28,524
Your body and your soul

1115
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:33,278
I got something for your mind

1116
00:52:33,362 --> 00:52:34,905
Your body and your soul

1117
00:52:41,161 --> 00:52:45,082
Here comes
the big-headed naked ass dippin'

1118
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:47,334
Sippin' on Crevassier

1119
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:50,420
Goddamn,
I must have the floss today

1120
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:52,047
Now, pimpin' ain't easy

1121
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,632
But it's necessary

1122
00:52:53,715 --> 00:52:57,177
So I'm chasin' bitches
like Tom chases Jerry

1123
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:59,763
I put the pedal to the floor

1124
00:52:59,847 --> 00:53:02,724
In my two-tone Ford Explorer

1125
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:05,060
You know how it's done

1126
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:06,645
Slammin', bumpin'

1127
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:10,274
Make that somethin' jump
on the one-ten

1128
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,776
She's flyin' in the Blazer

1129
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,945
Like no Speed Racer

1130
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:16,405
But I ain't gonna chase her

1131
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:18,824
Like Racer X

1132
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,701
But I won't flex

1133
00:53:20,784 --> 00:53:23,453
Till it's time to have sex

1134
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:25,747
So when you want
to get together?

1135
00:53:25,831 --> 00:53:30,627
'Cause you know a nigger like me
is down for whatever

1136
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,101
That was easy.

1137
00:53:46,185 --> 00:53:48,187
Yeah, I guess it was.

1138
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:49,897
What'd you do with the-

1139
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,815
Hey, man.

1140
00:53:51,899 --> 00:53:53,567
Oh, hey, Drew.

1141
00:53:53,650 --> 00:53:55,277
You guys hear
about Tom Smykowski?

1142
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,487
That he got laid off?

1143
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,030
No, man, check it out.

1144
00:53:58,113 --> 00:54:00,657
Last week, after he found out
he was getting laid off...

1145
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:04,077
he tries to kill himself by
running the car in the garage.

1146
00:54:04,161 --> 00:54:05,287
Is he dead?

1147
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:06,914
No, man, check it out.

1148
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:10,125
His wife comes home early
and catches him.

1149
00:54:10,209 --> 00:54:12,044
He tries to play it off
like nothing happened.

1150
00:54:12,127 --> 00:54:15,047
I was having some trouble
with the shifter here.

1151
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,465
It's jammed.

1152
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:19,009
I- I couldn't get it
into drive.

1153
00:54:19,092 --> 00:54:21,803
- I-I-I mean, reverse.
- You OK, Tom?

1154
00:54:21,887 --> 00:54:24,181
Then as he's lookin' at her...

1155
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:26,225
he decides he wants to live.

1156
00:54:26,308 --> 00:54:27,809
Yeah, I think I'm OK.

1157
00:54:27,893 --> 00:54:29,228
Right.

1158
00:54:29,311 --> 00:54:31,522
Seems to be working now.

1159
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:35,025
See you later, honey.

1160
00:54:35,108 --> 00:54:36,318
Love ya.

1161
00:54:37,945 --> 00:54:41,824
But as soon as he backs
out of his driveway... Bam!

1162
00:54:41,907 --> 00:54:44,535
He gets slammed big-time
by a drunk driver.

1163
00:54:44,618 --> 00:54:46,537
- Is he OK?
- Sort of.

1164
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,790
Broke both his wrists, legs,
a couple of ribs, his back...

1165
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:52,042
but he's getting
a huge settlement out of this.

1166
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,293
Like seven figures.

1167
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:54,878
He's getting out
of the hospital tomorrow.

1168
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:56,880
He's throwing a big party
this weekend to celebrate.

1169
00:54:56,964 --> 00:54:58,924
We're all invited.

1170
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:01,718
I'm thinking I might take
that new chick from logistics.

1171
00:55:01,802 --> 00:55:04,263
Things go well, I might be
showing her my "Oh" face.

1172
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:06,723
Oh, oh, oh...

1173
00:55:06,807 --> 00:55:09,852
You know what I'm talking about.
Oh.

1174
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:12,062
Yeah. Right.

1175
00:55:12,146 --> 00:55:13,480
See you guys there.

1176
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:18,026
Wow, our last day at Initech.

1177
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,321
I can't believe
they had security escort us out.

1178
00:55:21,405 --> 00:55:23,615
It's not like
we're going to steal something.

1179
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,035
I stole something.

1180
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,121
Oh, yeah. I guess we all did.

1181
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:31,874
No, I stole something else.

1182
00:55:32,916 --> 00:55:34,376
What did you steal?

1183
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:38,255
Call it a going-away present.

1184
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:57,608
Back up in
your ass with the resurrection

1185
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:59,067
Is the group
harder than an erection

1186
00:55:59,151 --> 00:56:00,903
That shows no affection

1187
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:02,738
They want to ban us
on Capitol Hill

1188
00:56:02,821 --> 00:56:04,198
'Cause it's die, motherfuckers

1189
00:56:04,281 --> 00:56:06,116
Die, motherfuckers

1190
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:08,243
Nothing but the ghetto

1191
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:10,078
Taking drugs, step slow

1192
00:56:10,162 --> 00:56:11,580
Kept my head low

1193
00:56:11,663 --> 00:56:12,873
And never let go

1194
00:56:12,956 --> 00:56:14,750
'Cause if I let go,
then I'd be spineless

1195
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:16,627
I'm going insane

1196
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,045
My mind, yes,
goes out of control

1197
00:56:18,128 --> 00:56:19,880
On some subjects
motherfuckers read on

1198
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:22,633
I done the shit
that they believe in

1199
00:56:22,716 --> 00:56:24,426
I see this motherfucker's
nine smokin'

1200
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:25,594
I seen this

1201
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:27,304
I bet you motherfuckers
will, too

1202
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:28,972
Because it's die, motherfucker

1203
00:56:29,056 --> 00:56:30,516
Die, motherfucker

1204
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,434
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1205
00:56:32,518 --> 00:56:35,437
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1206
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:38,899
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1207
00:56:38,982 --> 00:56:41,401
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1208
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:44,446
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1209
00:56:44,530 --> 00:56:47,199
Die, motherfuckers,
die, motherfuckers

1210
00:56:47,282 --> 00:56:49,576
Die, motherfucker,
die, motherfucker

1211
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:51,203
I think it's something
in the water

1212
00:56:51,286 --> 00:56:53,580
I think it's something
in the water

1213
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:55,541
So good to be free again

1214
00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:57,209
With unity for men

1215
00:56:57,292 --> 00:56:59,878
I walk around town
with a frown on my face

1216
00:56:59,962 --> 00:57:02,172
The whole world
gonna catch a murder case

1217
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:04,508
The murder rate may decrease

1218
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,552
If you're caught up
in the world while it's dying

1219
00:57:06,635 --> 00:57:08,929
I guarantee you'll fry,
'cause I am

1220
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:11,306
On the verge of knocking
motherfuckers out

1221
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,307
For no reason

1222
00:57:12,391 --> 00:57:15,394
Once I get down,
there'll be no breathin'

1223
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:16,937
Who's got my keys?

1224
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,355
I'm driving.

1225
00:57:18,438 --> 00:57:20,149
Everything is gonna be OK.

1226
00:57:20,232 --> 00:57:22,067
All right? OK?

1227
00:57:22,151 --> 00:57:23,735
It's fun, and it's exciting.

1228
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:26,363
I gotta-I gotta go. All right?

1229
00:57:26,446 --> 00:57:27,614
Joanna's coming over.

1230
00:57:27,698 --> 00:57:30,868
Don't worry.
You're worrying. All right?

1231
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:33,078
Monday morning, we're gonna
check the account balance.

1232
00:57:33,162 --> 00:57:34,246
Everything will be OK.

1233
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:36,456
Don't miss Tom's barbecue.
I'll see you there.

1234
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,250
All right? Good night!

1235
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:41,003
Back up in your ass
with the resurrection

1236
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:45,716
What were you guys
celebrating last night?

1237
00:57:45,799 --> 00:57:50,554
Oh, um... I'm not really
at liberty to talk about it.

1238
00:57:53,765 --> 00:57:55,392
I really can't.

1239
00:57:58,103 --> 00:58:01,148
So, when the subroutine
compounds the interest...

1240
00:58:01,231 --> 00:58:03,358
it uses all these
extra decimal places...

1241
00:58:03,442 --> 00:58:05,319
that just get rounded off.

1242
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:06,945
So we simplified
the whole thing...

1243
00:58:07,029 --> 00:58:10,282
and we round 'em all down
and drop the remainder...

1244
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:12,367
into an account that we opened.

1245
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:14,912
So you're stealing?

1246
00:58:15,996 --> 00:58:17,789
Uh, no.
No, you don't understand.

1247
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:21,627
It's, uh, very complicated.
It's, uh...

1248
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:24,755
It's aggregate, so I'm talking
about fractions of a penny...

1249
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:28,133
and, uh, over time,
they add up to a lot.

1250
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:31,970
Oh, OK. So you're gonna make
a lot of money, right?

1251
00:58:32,054 --> 00:58:33,305
- Yeah.
- Right.

1252
00:58:33,388 --> 00:58:34,473
It's not yours?

1253
00:58:34,556 --> 00:58:36,767
Uh... well, it becomes ours.

1254
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:38,644
How is that not stealing?

1255
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:44,525
I don't think
I'm explaining this very well.

1256
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:47,694
Um, the 7-Eleven, right?

1257
00:58:47,778 --> 00:58:50,030
You'd take a penny
from the tray.

1258
00:58:50,113 --> 00:58:51,365
From the crippled children?

1259
00:58:51,448 --> 00:58:52,616
No, that's the jar.

1260
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:56,161
I'm talking about the tray-
the pennies for everybody.

1261
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:57,621
Oh, for everybody. OK.

1262
00:58:57,704 --> 00:58:59,748
Yeah.
Well, those are whole pennies.

1263
00:58:59,832 --> 00:59:03,669
I'm just talking about
fractions of a penny, OK?

1264
00:59:03,752 --> 00:59:05,546
But we do it
from a much bigger tray...

1265
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:07,673
and we do it
a couple of million times.

1266
00:59:07,756 --> 00:59:09,258
So what's wrong with that?

1267
00:59:09,341 --> 00:59:10,968
I don't know.
It just seems wrong.

1268
00:59:11,051 --> 00:59:12,177
It's not wrong.

1269
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:13,470
Initech is wrong.

1270
00:59:13,554 --> 00:59:16,056
Initech is an evil corporation,
all right?

1271
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:18,183
Chotchkie's is wrong.

1272
00:59:18,267 --> 00:59:20,185
Doesn't it bother you that you
have to get up in the morning...

1273
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:22,312
and you have to put on
a bunch of pieces of flair?

1274
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,773
Yeah, but I'm not about
to go in and start...

1275
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:26,483
taking money from the register.

1276
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:27,818
Well, maybe you should.

1277
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:32,865
The Nazis had pieces of flair
that they made the Jews wear.

1278
00:59:32,948 --> 00:59:34,241
What?

1279
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:37,578
Look, we don't... I'm-

1280
00:59:37,661 --> 00:59:39,288
We don't have
to talk about this now.

1281
00:59:39,371 --> 00:59:42,875
Let's just go to the barbecue,
all right?

1282
00:59:45,878 --> 00:59:48,589
Michael, Samir,
how you doin'?

1283
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:49,798
- Hey, Tom.
- Hello, Tom.

1284
00:59:49,882 --> 00:59:52,968
I'd like you to meet
my lawyer Rob Newhouse.

1285
00:59:53,051 --> 00:59:55,762
Rob, Michael. Samir.

1286
00:59:55,846 --> 00:59:59,308
Peter! How are you?
I'm glad you could make it.

1287
00:59:59,391 --> 01:00:02,352
Tom, hi. This is somebody
I'd like you to meet.

1288
01:00:02,436 --> 01:00:04,313
- This is, uh, Joanna.
- Hi.

1289
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:06,773
Hi. Forgive me
for not getting up.

1290
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:16,283
Ooh, ooh.

1291
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:18,785
Peter, come here a minute.
I wanna show you something.

1292
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,789
Well... what do you think?
It's a prototype.

1293
01:00:22,873 --> 01:00:24,625
Huh... that's...

1294
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,252
that's exactly as you
described it.

1295
01:00:29,254 --> 01:00:31,840
Uh, listen, I heard about
your-your settlement.

1296
01:00:31,924 --> 01:00:33,091
Congratulations.

1297
01:00:33,175 --> 01:00:34,301
Well, thanks, Peter.

1298
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:38,263
You know, I'm glad you're here,
because I wanted to talk to you.

1299
01:00:38,347 --> 01:00:41,642
I know how you get depressed
about your job and all, and...

1300
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:44,394
I just wanted you to know
that I know how you feel.

1301
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:46,188
I used to be the same way.

1302
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:48,232
- Really?
- Sure.

1303
01:00:48,315 --> 01:00:49,983
Maybe I didn't whine as much.

1304
01:00:50,067 --> 01:00:52,861
But I bet I hated my job
even more than you...

1305
01:00:52,945 --> 01:00:55,239
and I'd been doing it
for over thirty years.

1306
01:00:55,322 --> 01:00:56,657
Wow.

1307
01:00:56,740 --> 01:01:00,285
Just remember, if you
hang in there long enough...

1308
01:01:00,369 --> 01:01:03,539
good things can happen
in this world.

1309
01:01:03,622 --> 01:01:05,707
I mean, look at me.

1310
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,126
Thanks, Tom.

1311
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:11,046
Ah, sure.

1312
01:01:16,468 --> 01:01:19,680
Conjugal visits?
Not that I know of.

1313
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:22,391
Minimum-security prison
is no picnic.

1314
01:01:22,474 --> 01:01:24,601
I have a client in there
right now.

1315
01:01:24,685 --> 01:01:26,311
He says the trick is...

1316
01:01:26,395 --> 01:01:28,230
kick someone's ass
the first day...

1317
01:01:28,313 --> 01:01:29,773
or become someone's bitch.

1318
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:32,442
Then everything
will be all right.

1319
01:01:32,526 --> 01:01:34,153
Why do you ask, anyway?

1320
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:36,488
Oh, no, we just-

1321
01:01:36,572 --> 01:01:37,781
It's a...

1322
01:01:44,037 --> 01:01:46,081
- Hey, Peter.
- Drew.

1323
01:01:46,165 --> 01:01:48,333
That's something
about old Smykowski, huh?

1324
01:01:48,417 --> 01:01:50,210
- Yeah.
- Lucky bastard.

1325
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:54,590
Hey, isn't that the girl
that works over at Chotchkie's?

1326
01:01:54,673 --> 01:01:56,425
Yep.

1327
01:01:56,508 --> 01:01:58,093
Who's she here with?

1328
01:01:58,177 --> 01:01:59,469
She's with me.

1329
01:02:01,305 --> 01:02:03,390
- Really?
- Yep.

1330
01:02:03,473 --> 01:02:06,894
All right, Peter.
Ooh, ooh, right on.

1331
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:10,063
Make sure you wear a rubber,
dude.

1332
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:13,484
Why's that, Drew?

1333
01:02:13,567 --> 01:02:15,235
Are you kidding me?

1334
01:02:15,319 --> 01:02:17,362
She gets around. All right?

1335
01:02:18,864 --> 01:02:20,866
She does, does she?

1336
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:23,076
Oh, yeah, like a record.

1337
01:02:25,996 --> 01:02:27,414
Like with who?

1338
01:02:27,498 --> 01:02:30,417
Oh, let's see, uh...

1339
01:02:30,501 --> 01:02:32,628
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1340
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:35,464
Uh, let me see, who else?

1341
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:38,759
Lumbergh?

1342
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:43,472
What if you get caught?

1343
01:02:43,555 --> 01:02:46,809
Oh, I just don't know
if this was such a good idea.

1344
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:49,937
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
for you to sleep with Lumbergh.

1345
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,313
What?

1346
01:02:51,396 --> 01:02:52,606
What are you-

1347
01:02:53,774 --> 01:02:55,776
Oh, right, Lumbergh.

1348
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:57,319
Aah!

1349
01:02:57,402 --> 01:03:00,489
Oh... God... Lumbergh!

1350
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:02,533
Peter, what is wrong with you?

1351
01:03:02,616 --> 01:03:04,326
That was, like, two years ago.

1352
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:05,786
What? Did you know him?

1353
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:07,454
Yeah, I know him. I know him.

1354
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:08,831
He's my boss.

1355
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:12,292
He's my unholy,
disgusting pig of a boss.

1356
01:03:12,376 --> 01:03:14,461
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

1357
01:03:14,545 --> 01:03:17,798
He represents all
that is soulless and wrong...

1358
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:19,591
and you slept with him.

1359
01:03:19,675 --> 01:03:23,053
Hey, that is none
of your business, OK?

1360
01:03:23,136 --> 01:03:25,973
I didn't ask you who you slept
with before we were together.

1361
01:03:26,056 --> 01:03:27,224
I don't care.

1362
01:03:27,307 --> 01:03:29,351
I didn't think you
slept with guys like Lumbergh!

1363
01:03:29,434 --> 01:03:31,645
Listen to you.

1364
01:03:31,728 --> 01:03:33,188
Who do you think you are?

1365
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:35,774
How dare you judge me?

1366
01:03:35,858 --> 01:03:38,652
I mean, what are you?
You think you're an angel?

1367
01:03:38,735 --> 01:03:41,446
No, you're just
this penny-stealing...

1368
01:03:41,530 --> 01:03:44,199
wannabe criminal man.

1369
01:03:44,283 --> 01:03:45,951
Yeah, well, that may be.

1370
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:48,495
But at least I never
slept with Lumbergh.

1371
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:49,872
OK, that's... I'm done.

1372
01:03:49,997 --> 01:03:53,125
I wanna get out of the car, OK?
Stop.

1373
01:03:53,208 --> 01:03:55,043
Call me when you grow up.

1374
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:57,254
Wait. That's probably
never gonna happen.

1375
01:03:57,337 --> 01:03:58,547
So don't call me, OK?

1376
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,841
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!

1377
01:04:07,681 --> 01:04:09,475
Hell, Lumbergh fucked her.

1378
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:11,101
Lumbergh fucked her.

1379
01:04:11,185 --> 01:04:13,353
Lumbergh fucked her.

1380
01:04:13,437 --> 01:04:15,355
That is great.

1381
01:04:15,439 --> 01:04:18,484
I mean, she was seeing
the "Oh" face for sure.

1382
01:04:18,567 --> 01:04:22,321
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

1383
01:04:22,404 --> 01:04:23,989
Ooh.

1384
01:04:24,072 --> 01:04:26,700
If you could just move
a little bit to the left.

1385
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:29,161
That's it. Great.

1386
01:04:29,244 --> 01:04:31,371
Peter, what's happening?

1387
01:04:31,455 --> 01:04:36,293
Um, could you give me
those T.P.S. reports ASAP, OK?

1388
01:04:36,376 --> 01:04:37,586
Oh!

1389
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:53,393
- Joanna.
- Yeah.

1390
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:55,771
We need to talk.

1391
01:04:55,854 --> 01:04:57,773
Do you know what this is about?

1392
01:05:01,652 --> 01:05:03,237
My, uh, flair?

1393
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,447
Yeah.

1394
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:09,326
Or your lack of flair,
because, uh...

1395
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:11,787
I'm counting,
and I only see fifteen pieces.

1396
01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:14,164
Let me ask you a question,
Joanna.

1397
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:18,335
What do you think of a person
who only does the bare minimum?

1398
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:22,631
Huh, what do I think?
Um, you know what, Stan...

1399
01:05:23,924 --> 01:05:26,927
if you want me to wear
thirty-seven pieces of flair...

1400
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,346
like your, uh, pretty boy
over there, Brian...

1401
01:05:29,429 --> 01:05:31,014
why don't you just
make the minimum...

1402
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:33,058
thirty-seven pieces of flair?

1403
01:05:33,142 --> 01:05:35,727
Well, I thought
I remembered you saying...

1404
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:38,021
that you wanted
to express yourself.

1405
01:05:38,105 --> 01:05:40,065
Yeah.
You know what? Yeah, I do.

1406
01:05:40,149 --> 01:05:42,609
I do want to express myself.

1407
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:45,487
And I don't need thirty-seven
pieces of flair to do it.

1408
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:49,658
All right? There's my flair. OK?

1409
01:05:49,741 --> 01:05:54,037
And this is me
expressing myself. OK?

1410
01:05:54,121 --> 01:05:55,789
There it is.

1411
01:05:55,873 --> 01:05:57,416
I hate this job.

1412
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:00,169
I hate this goddamn job,
and I don't need it.

1413
01:06:15,976 --> 01:06:17,060
Oh, shit.

1414
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:18,729
- Shit.
- Shit.

1415
01:06:18,812 --> 01:06:21,315
- Shit.
- Son of a bitch.

1416
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:24,109
- Shit.
- This is a fuck.

1417
01:06:24,193 --> 01:06:25,277
I- I... Shit.

1418
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,820
What happened?

1419
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:29,031
You tell me, Michael!
It's your software!

1420
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:30,657
Yes, it's your software.

1421
01:06:30,741 --> 01:06:32,910
Corporate accounting
is sure as hell gonna notice...

1422
01:06:32,993 --> 01:06:35,662
three hundred five thousand,
three hundred...

1423
01:06:35,746 --> 01:06:38,999
twenty-six thirteen, Michael!

1424
01:06:39,082 --> 01:06:40,375
Oh, shit.

1425
01:06:40,459 --> 01:06:42,461
They probably
won't know it's gone...

1426
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:44,296
for another three or four days.

1427
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:47,925
Michael! You said this thing
was gonna take two years.

1428
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:50,511
What happened? You said
the thing was supposed to work!

1429
01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:51,803
Technically, it did work.

1430
01:06:51,887 --> 01:06:53,180
No, it didn't!

1431
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:56,183
It did not work, Michael, OK?

1432
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:57,810
OK.

1433
01:06:57,893 --> 01:07:01,021
I must have put a decimal point
in the wrong place or something.

1434
01:07:01,104 --> 01:07:03,607
I always do that. I always
mess up some mundane detail.

1435
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:07,694
Oh! Well, this is not
a mundane detail, Michael!

1436
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:09,321
Quit getting pissed at me.

1437
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:11,281
This was all your idea, asshole.

1438
01:07:12,574 --> 01:07:14,493
All right. OK.

1439
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:17,079
Let's try not to get
pissed off at each other.

1440
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:19,665
Let's calm down, try to figure
this thing out together.

1441
01:07:19,748 --> 01:07:23,460
We gotta close that account
before it gets bigger.

1442
01:07:23,544 --> 01:07:27,714
Happy birthday to you

1443
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:32,761
Happy birthday to you

1444
01:07:32,845 --> 01:07:38,475
Happy birthday, Mr. Lumbergh

1445
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,646
Happy birthday to you

1446
01:07:46,984 --> 01:07:48,318
Looks terrific.

1447
01:07:48,402 --> 01:07:49,528
Mmm.

1448
01:07:49,611 --> 01:07:52,281
Here, Peg, you wanna
get everybody started?

1449
01:07:55,576 --> 01:07:56,702
Mmm.

1450
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,203
Oh, that is terrific.

1451
01:07:58,287 --> 01:07:59,580
Just terrific.

1452
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:03,375
Thanks, everybody.
I really, really appreciate it.

1453
01:08:03,458 --> 01:08:04,751
It's very special.

1454
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:07,087
Now, Milton, don't be greedy.

1455
01:08:07,171 --> 01:08:10,424
Let's pass it along and make
sure everyone gets a piece.

1456
01:08:10,507 --> 01:08:13,594
But last time I didn't
receive a piece and I was told-

1457
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:15,179
Just pass.

1458
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:20,476
OK, here. But this...

1459
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:25,564
The cake...
There's lots of cake?

1460
01:08:26,607 --> 01:08:29,610
The ratio of people to cake
is too big.

1461
01:08:46,835 --> 01:08:49,630
I could set
the building on fire.

1462
01:08:49,713 --> 01:08:53,800
Is there some way
to just give the money back?

1463
01:08:53,884 --> 01:08:56,678
Hand them a check for the exact
amount they're missing?

1464
01:08:56,762 --> 01:08:59,681
I- I think
they'd figure that out.

1465
01:08:59,765 --> 01:09:01,934
Well, we have to do something.

1466
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:04,019
Maybe we could launder
the money.

1467
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:07,314
That's a great idea.

1468
01:09:07,397 --> 01:09:08,482
OK, how do we do that?

1469
01:09:08,565 --> 01:09:10,234
I don't know.

1470
01:09:10,317 --> 01:09:11,985
I don't even know what it means.
I was hoping you knew.

1471
01:09:12,069 --> 01:09:13,821
I think coke dealers do it.

1472
01:09:13,904 --> 01:09:16,448
OK, all right.
Do we know any coke dealers?

1473
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:18,826
My cousin's a cokehead.

1474
01:09:24,373 --> 01:09:25,874
Fuck.

1475
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:27,209
We're in deep shit.

1476
01:09:27,292 --> 01:09:31,046
Yes, we are in very,
very deep shit.

1477
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:37,928
- Milton.
- Yes.

1478
01:09:38,011 --> 01:09:39,179
What's happening?

1479
01:09:39,263 --> 01:09:41,765
Say, Milton,
you know what'd be great?

1480
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:42,933
But... no.

1481
01:09:43,016 --> 01:09:44,810
Since you're down here...

1482
01:09:44,893 --> 01:09:48,063
it would be really great
if you could just sort of...

1483
01:09:48,147 --> 01:09:50,899
take care of the cockroach
problem we've had in here.

1484
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:53,986
That's really not my job, and I
haven't received my paycheck...

1485
01:09:54,069 --> 01:09:55,863
For now,
why don't you go ahead...

1486
01:09:55,946 --> 01:09:59,324
and get yourself a flashlight
and a can of pesticide...

1487
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:00,534
and crawl down-

1488
01:10:00,617 --> 01:10:03,036
Bill?
We need you upstairs right away.

1489
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:04,955
We got a big problem-big.

1490
01:10:05,038 --> 01:10:07,958
Some major glitch in accounting,
a lot of money missing.

1491
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:14,381
'Scuse me.

1492
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:17,384
'Scuse me.

1493
01:10:20,053 --> 01:10:23,974
OK... but that's
the last straw.

1494
01:10:24,057 --> 01:10:26,518
Here we go, here we go.

1495
01:10:26,602 --> 01:10:30,814
Uh, launder.
"To clean," no. "To wash-"

1496
01:10:30,898 --> 01:10:34,109
"To conceal the source
of money...

1497
01:10:34,193 --> 01:10:37,446
"as by channeling it through
an intermediary. "

1498
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:39,615
"To conceal... "

1499
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:42,201
That doesn't really
help us, Michael.

1500
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:43,952
I can't believe
what a bunch of nerds we are.

1501
01:10:44,036 --> 01:10:46,163
We're looking up money
laundering in a dictionary.

1502
01:10:46,246 --> 01:10:50,751
Yeah, well, you guys
can both eat my ass, OK?

1503
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:52,586
I can't believe Joanna
slept with Lumbergh.

1504
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:53,879
That's what I can't believe.

1505
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:56,882
- Yeah. You didn't know that?
- Yeah, you didn't know that?

1506
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:59,009
A couple of years ago,
before he moved to Atlanta.

1507
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:05,265
You mean Ron Lumbergh,
the Initrode guy? The young guy?

1508
01:11:05,349 --> 01:11:07,893
Yeah.
Who'd you think I meant? Bill?

1509
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:12,773
Her fucking-Her children
would have hooves.

1510
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:16,276
Ron's not related to Bill,
is he?

1511
01:11:17,778 --> 01:11:19,446
Who's that?

1512
01:11:20,489 --> 01:11:21,949
All right, nobody panic.

1513
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:23,742
Probably just Lawrence.

1514
01:11:27,246 --> 01:11:28,956
Good evening, sir.
My name is Steve.

1515
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:30,582
I come from a rough area.

1516
01:11:30,666 --> 01:11:32,251
I used to be addicted
to crack...

1517
01:11:32,334 --> 01:11:34,253
but now I'm off
and trying to stay clean.

1518
01:11:34,336 --> 01:11:36,755
That is why I'm selling
magazine subscriptions.

1519
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:38,799
- No, no.
- Wait a minute.

1520
01:11:38,882 --> 01:11:40,884
You used to be
addicted to crack?

1521
01:11:42,135 --> 01:11:43,637
Yeah. Um...

1522
01:11:45,305 --> 01:11:47,432
Look, I'm very sorry.

1523
01:11:47,516 --> 01:11:50,018
I do not know anything
about any money laundering.

1524
01:11:50,102 --> 01:11:52,521
We're not asking you
about money laundering.

1525
01:11:52,604 --> 01:11:53,981
All we need is for you
to hook us-

1526
01:11:54,064 --> 01:11:55,816
If he doesn't
know anybody-

1527
01:11:55,899 --> 01:11:57,651
No. Wait a minute.

1528
01:11:57,734 --> 01:12:00,654
Look, you just give us
the name of one drug dealer.

1529
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:03,115
I could talk to him.
I have good networking skill.

1530
01:12:03,198 --> 01:12:04,324
I lied.

1531
01:12:04,408 --> 01:12:07,452
All that stuff I said
about being a crackhead...

1532
01:12:07,536 --> 01:12:09,955
just helps me sell magazines.

1533
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:12,541
I'm actually an unemployed
software engineer.

1534
01:12:16,378 --> 01:12:19,464
- You're a software engineer?
- Yep.

1535
01:12:19,548 --> 01:12:22,092
Things, they must be
very rough for you.

1536
01:12:22,176 --> 01:12:23,802
Actually, man...

1537
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:25,888
I make more money selling
magazine subscriptions...

1538
01:12:25,971 --> 01:12:27,431
than I ever did at Initrode.

1539
01:12:27,514 --> 01:12:29,641
Heh. At Initrode?

1540
01:12:29,725 --> 01:12:31,685
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna tell anybody...

1541
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:33,103
about all this stuff
we told you.

1542
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:36,398
I mean, we know a lot of
the same people. That's...

1543
01:12:38,275 --> 01:12:40,903
Actually, um,
that all depends.

1544
01:12:45,782 --> 01:12:48,869
What am I gonna do with
forty subscriptions to "Vibe"?

1545
01:12:50,162 --> 01:12:51,246
We never should have done this.

1546
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:53,165
What were we thinking?

1547
01:12:54,124 --> 01:12:55,209
You know what I can't
figure out?

1548
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:58,462
How is it that all these stupid
Neanderthal Mafia guys...

1549
01:12:58,545 --> 01:12:59,922
can be so good at crime...

1550
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:02,466
and smart guys like us
can suck so badly at it?

1551
01:13:02,549 --> 01:13:04,051
We're new to it, though.

1552
01:13:04,134 --> 01:13:06,678
If we had more experience...

1553
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:10,140
No. You know what I think?
I think we're screwed.

1554
01:13:10,224 --> 01:13:11,683
I think
there's enough evidence...

1555
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,769
all over that building
to link us to this.

1556
01:13:13,852 --> 01:13:15,938
Even if we could launder money,
I wouldn't want to.

1557
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:17,606
What we've done is bad enough.

1558
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:18,941
We get caught
laundering money...

1559
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:21,026
we're not going
to white-collar resort prison.

1560
01:13:21,109 --> 01:13:24,029
No. We're going to federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1561
01:13:24,112 --> 01:13:26,156
I don't want to go
to any prison.

1562
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,492
Why the hell did I do this?

1563
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,203
I've never done anything wrong
in my whole life.

1564
01:13:31,286 --> 01:13:32,538
We weren't thinking clearly...

1565
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:34,748
because you told us
we were losing our jobs.

1566
01:13:34,832 --> 01:13:37,209
Now look at us, we're worried
about going in a prison.

1567
01:13:37,292 --> 01:13:39,503
Don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.

1568
01:13:41,171 --> 01:13:43,215
I'm going home.

1569
01:13:43,298 --> 01:13:44,466
Me, too.

1570
01:13:46,176 --> 01:13:50,305
You are a very...
bad person, Peter.

1571
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:11,827
Lawrence, you awake?

1572
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,120
Yeah.

1573
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:16,123
You wanna come over?

1574
01:14:16,206 --> 01:14:17,291
No, thanks, man.

1575
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:19,585
I don't want you
fucking up my life, too.

1576
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:28,051
In light of the senselessness
of these heinous crimes...

1577
01:14:28,135 --> 01:14:30,512
that you have committed
against Initech...

1578
01:14:30,596 --> 01:14:33,640
I hereby sentence you,
Michael Bolton...

1579
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:38,562
and Samir Naan-Nanadajibad...

1580
01:14:38,645 --> 01:14:40,856
to a term of no less
than four years...

1581
01:14:40,939 --> 01:14:44,568
in a federal
"pound me in the ass" prison.

1582
01:14:48,405 --> 01:14:50,199
Peter Gibbons...

1583
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:53,035
you've led a trite
and meaningless life...

1584
01:14:54,786 --> 01:14:57,664
and you're a very bad person.

1585
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:36,078
Hey.

1586
01:15:37,496 --> 01:15:40,040
You're not working
at Chotchkie's anymore, huh?

1587
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:42,334
No, no. I got fired.

1588
01:15:43,126 --> 01:15:45,587
- What happened?
- I flipped off my boss.

1589
01:15:45,671 --> 01:15:47,756
Some customers...

1590
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,591
Actually, a line cook...

1591
01:15:49,675 --> 01:15:51,635
but he just happened
to be standing there, so...

1592
01:15:52,970 --> 01:15:55,055
I might be going away
for a while.

1593
01:15:55,139 --> 01:15:58,559
Uh... to jail.

1594
01:15:58,642 --> 01:16:00,561
You were right
about that computer scam.

1595
01:16:00,644 --> 01:16:01,937
That was a bad idea.

1596
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:04,565
I'm gonna take the blame for it,
I decided.

1597
01:16:05,732 --> 01:16:07,985
I'm on my way now
to return the money...

1598
01:16:08,068 --> 01:16:10,487
and leave the confession
under Lumbergh's door.

1599
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:14,116
Joanna, I want to apologize.

1600
01:16:14,199 --> 01:16:16,660
I had no right to get pissed off
at you about Lumbergh.

1601
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:18,328
Lumbergh is not my problem.

1602
01:16:18,412 --> 01:16:20,455
It wasn't even
the right Lumbergh.

1603
01:16:20,539 --> 01:16:24,501
I don't know why I can't just...
go to work and be happy...

1604
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:26,962
like I'm supposed to,
like everybody else.

1605
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:29,214
Peter, most people
don't like their jobs.

1606
01:16:29,298 --> 01:16:33,302
But you go out there and find
something that makes you happy.

1607
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:35,220
Yeah. Well...

1608
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,974
I may never be happy
at my job...

1609
01:16:39,057 --> 01:16:41,894
but I think that if
I could be with you...

1610
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:44,021
that I could be happy
with my life.

1611
01:16:44,104 --> 01:16:46,064
I've been a real asshole.

1612
01:16:46,148 --> 01:16:49,276
But, if you'd give it
another shot, I promise-

1613
01:16:49,359 --> 01:16:50,569
OK, shut up.

1614
01:16:55,032 --> 01:16:57,743
Whoa! Hey, what's going on here?

1615
01:16:57,826 --> 01:17:00,329
Get a room, you two! Ha ha!

1616
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:05,876
I hate that guy.

1617
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:59,763
Then Mr. Lumbergh
told me to talk to payroll...

1618
01:17:59,930 --> 01:18:01,598
and then payroll told me
to talk to Mr. Lumbergh.

1619
01:18:01,682 --> 01:18:04,143
And I still haven't received
my paycheck.

1620
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:06,937
And he took my stapler,
and he never brought it back.

1621
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:09,314
And then they moved my desk
to storage room "B."

1622
01:18:09,398 --> 01:18:11,275
And there was
garbage on it, and-

1623
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:13,819
Why don't you go back down
and sit at your desk?

1624
01:18:13,902 --> 01:18:15,404
Mr. Lumbergh
should be here any minute.

1625
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:18,699
- Mr. Lumbergh-
- Just go sit at your desk.

1626
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:21,243
OK. But, I-I'm gonna just...

1627
01:18:28,917 --> 01:18:30,794
I have to take
my stapler back...

1628
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:34,548
because I told him
it's my stapler.

1629
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:41,305
It's my stapler.

1630
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:45,100
A Swingline, the brand
I've been using for a long time.

1631
01:19:04,244 --> 01:19:05,579
Lawrence, you in there?

1632
01:19:07,456 --> 01:19:09,500
Whoa. Hey, Peter, man.

1633
01:19:09,583 --> 01:19:11,251
Hey.

1634
01:19:11,335 --> 01:19:13,545
So, I might be going away
for a while.

1635
01:19:13,629 --> 01:19:15,547
Yeah, I know, man.

1636
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:18,133
It's a bummer, dude.
What can I say?

1637
01:19:18,217 --> 01:19:20,219
Yeah. Yeah.

1638
01:19:21,929 --> 01:19:25,432
Well, time to go face the music.

1639
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:28,101
You take care of yourself
if I don't see you, all right?

1640
01:19:28,185 --> 01:19:30,729
You too, man.
Take her easy, bud.

1641
01:19:30,813 --> 01:19:32,231
All right.

1642
01:19:33,357 --> 01:19:34,733
Hey, Peter.

1643
01:19:34,817 --> 01:19:36,485
Yeah?

1644
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:39,279
Watch out for your cornhole,
bud.

1645
01:19:40,781 --> 01:19:42,241
OK, Lawrence.

1646
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:58,465
Stay clear, now.
Stay clear.

1647
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:00,717
Holy shit.

1648
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:12,956
Wait a minute.
Let me take a look at that.

1649
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,167
You don't want that, Peter, man.

1650
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,627
That's toasted, man.

1651
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:19,922
I think I know someone
who might want this.

1652
01:21:31,266 --> 01:21:32,392
Hey, man.

1653
01:21:33,685 --> 01:21:35,437
Wanna go to lunch?

1654
01:21:36,230 --> 01:21:37,523
Brought mine in a pail...

1655
01:21:37,606 --> 01:21:40,192
plus Joanna's supposed
to come by a little later.

1656
01:21:41,193 --> 01:21:43,612
How do you like your new job?

1657
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:45,614
Not too bad, not too bad.

1658
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:47,241
How's Penetrode?

1659
01:21:47,324 --> 01:21:48,992
Initrode.

1660
01:21:49,076 --> 01:21:50,369
They're all right.

1661
01:21:50,452 --> 01:21:51,745
It's work.

1662
01:21:51,829 --> 01:21:53,539
Yeah, yeah.

1663
01:21:53,622 --> 01:21:55,332
Probably get you a job there.

1664
01:21:55,415 --> 01:21:57,209
No, thanks. I, uh...

1665
01:21:57,292 --> 01:21:58,710
I'm doing good here.

1666
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:04,299
So, uh...
we're gonna be OK, right?

1667
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:06,218
Yeah.

1668
01:22:07,136 --> 01:22:09,596
I think the fire pretty much
took care of everything.

1669
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,266
I wonder if the money burn up.

1670
01:22:12,349 --> 01:22:13,600
It would be shame.

1671
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:15,060
Yeah.

1672
01:22:15,144 --> 01:22:18,021
So you sure you don't
want us to get you a job?

1673
01:22:18,105 --> 01:22:21,400
That's one thing
I'm definitely sure of.

1674
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:25,445
All right, chief.

1675
01:22:25,529 --> 01:22:26,780
You guys take care, all right?

1676
01:22:26,864 --> 01:22:28,240
All right.

1677
01:22:29,366 --> 01:22:30,367
Stay in touch, man.

1678
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:32,202
OK. Will do.

1679
01:22:36,456 --> 01:22:38,375
This isn't so bad, huh?

1680
01:22:39,543 --> 01:22:44,506
Making bucks, getting exercise,
working outside.

1681
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:46,383
Fuckin' "A."

1682
01:22:48,969 --> 01:22:50,762
Fuckin' "A."

1683
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:11,408
Excuse me. Excuse me, seor.

1684
01:23:11,492 --> 01:23:13,327
May I speak to you, please?

1685
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:16,038
I asked for a mai tai,
and they brought a pia colada.

1686
01:23:16,121 --> 01:23:18,415
And I said no salt, no salt...

1687
01:23:18,499 --> 01:23:20,209
for the margarita,
but it had salt on it.

1688
01:23:20,292 --> 01:23:22,878
Lo siento mucho, seor.
Pinche gringo.

1689
01:23:22,961 --> 01:23:26,590
I won't be leaving a tip,
'cause I could...

1690
01:23:26,673 --> 01:23:28,467
I could shut
this whole resort down.

1691
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:30,093
Sir?

1692
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:34,640
I'll take my traveler's checks
to a competing resort.

1693
01:23:36,558 --> 01:23:39,102
I could write a letter
to your board of tourism.

1694
01:23:39,186 --> 01:23:41,396
I could have this place
condemned.

1695
01:23:41,480 --> 01:23:46,276
I could put, I could put
strychnine in the guacamole.

1696
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:48,070
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1697
01:23:48,153 --> 01:23:48,821
There was salt on the glass,
big grains of salt.

1698
01:24:03,752 --> 01:24:05,712
Give a ride
on the old bone roller coaster.

1699
01:24:05,796 --> 01:24:07,798
Aaaah!

1700
01:24:08,841 --> 01:24:10,217
Yeah

1701
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:13,637
Yo, 6:00 every morning,
you're waking up yawnin'

1702
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,722
To the sound
of your alarm clock alarmin'

1703
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:17,057
About an hour from now

1704
01:24:17,141 --> 01:24:19,226
You should be
at your place of employment

1705
01:24:19,309 --> 01:24:21,145
Which is annoyin'
'cause it's so borin'

1706
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:22,354
You coworkers are talking

1707
01:24:22,437 --> 01:24:24,064
Don't come back
in a dress, man.

1708
01:24:24,148 --> 01:24:26,316
Ha ha ha. You big fag.

1709
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,735
You wonder
why your workload is so enormous

1710
01:24:28,819 --> 01:24:32,072
'Cause your boss just laid
off 3/4 of the whole office

1711
01:24:32,156 --> 01:24:34,283
People get depressed,
they get ulcers

1712
01:24:34,366 --> 01:24:36,994
From the stress that
the corporate environment causes

1713
01:24:37,077 --> 01:24:39,746
Regardless of how
you ultimately wanna solve this

1714
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:42,332
Seems to me like you've
got one of four choices

1715
01:24:42,416 --> 01:24:44,793
You can take a new job offer
for more chips

1716
01:24:44,877 --> 01:24:47,504
Stick it out a little longer
or forfeit

1717
01:24:47,588 --> 01:24:49,047
But my advice to anybody-

1718
01:24:49,131 --> 01:24:50,340
I'm working
at Hooters now, you know...

1719
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:52,426
and it's very cool.

1720
01:24:52,509 --> 01:24:55,095
Take this job and shove it

1721
01:24:55,179 --> 01:24:58,098
I ain't working here no more

1722
01:24:58,182 --> 01:25:00,309
Take this job and shove it

1723
01:25:00,392 --> 01:25:03,437
I ain't working here no more

1724
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,606
Take this job and shove it

1725
01:25:05,689 --> 01:25:08,525
Just shove it,
take this job and shove it

1726
01:25:08,609 --> 01:25:11,320
Take this job, take this job

1727
01:25:11,403 --> 01:25:13,322
take this job and shove it,
shove it

1728
01:25:13,405 --> 01:25:15,532
Yo, if your boss is a S.O.B.

1729
01:25:15,616 --> 01:25:18,660
Tell him to s-h-o-v-e the j-o-b

1730
01:25:18,744 --> 01:25:21,079
Put your middle finger
up slowly

1731
01:25:21,163 --> 01:25:24,458
Put it close enough to his face
so he can examine it closely

1732
01:25:24,541 --> 01:25:26,251
Say "I ain't working here
no more

1733
01:25:26,335 --> 01:25:27,544
"Who do you think you are?"

1734
01:25:27,628 --> 01:25:29,296
Whip the apron off,
throw it on the floor

1735
01:25:29,379 --> 01:25:32,674
Run to the door, to the pay
phone, make a toll-free call

1736
01:25:32,758 --> 01:25:34,802
Tell your stocks what happened
and where you are

1737
01:25:34,885 --> 01:25:37,304
So they can come
and get you in the car later on

1738
01:25:37,387 --> 01:25:39,973
And help you search
for a new nine-to-five job

1739
01:25:40,057 --> 01:25:42,434
If the unemployment line
ain't that long

1740
01:25:42,518 --> 01:25:45,187
You can take your time
filling out W-9 forms

1741
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:48,148
Eventually, you'll get on
if you try hard enough

1742
01:25:48,232 --> 01:25:50,818
And you get money if you keep
punching your time card enough

1743
01:25:50,901 --> 01:25:52,486
Maybe you hate it,
maybe you love it

1744
01:25:52,569 --> 01:25:54,446
But if you hate it,
all you gotta do

1745
01:25:54,530 --> 01:25:56,031
Is get mad
and tell your boss to

1746
01:25:56,114 --> 01:25:57,991
Take this job and shove it

1747
01:25:58,075 --> 01:26:01,370
I ain't working here no more

1748
01:26:01,453 --> 01:26:03,288
Take this job and shove it

1749
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:06,542
I ain't working here no more

1750
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,877
Take this job and shove it

1751
01:26:08,961 --> 01:26:11,797
I ain't working here no more

1752
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:16,593
Take this job, take this job,
take this job and shove it

1753
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:19,263
Yo, so mind
your patience or like slave gigs

1754
01:26:19,346 --> 01:26:21,765
The boss' favorite to get
placed in something spacious

1755
01:26:21,849 --> 01:26:23,392
While the most hated get placed

1756
01:26:23,475 --> 01:26:25,060
In some small cubicle spaces

1757
01:26:25,144 --> 01:26:26,687
Or get thrown down
in the basement

1758
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:29,481
Get your stapler confiscated,
you constantly waitin'

1759
01:26:29,565 --> 01:26:31,733
For a paycheck,
twelve months pass by

1760
01:26:31,817 --> 01:26:33,068
And you still ain't get paid yet

1761
01:26:33,152 --> 01:26:34,611
Here's an optimistic motto

1762
01:26:34,695 --> 01:26:36,321
If you ever late for today

1763
01:26:36,405 --> 01:26:38,240
You can stay early for tomorrow

1764
01:26:38,323 --> 01:26:39,950
Most nine-to-fives are hard

1765
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:41,410
'Cause the description
of the job

1766
01:26:41,493 --> 01:26:43,203
Ain't no picnic in the park

1767
01:26:43,287 --> 01:26:46,081
People get hired,
drink coffee to stay wired

1768
01:26:46,165 --> 01:26:48,625
So they don't get tired,
sleep late, and get fired

1769
01:26:48,709 --> 01:26:51,086
You came in
late, you already ate

1770
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,714
Now, you want
to take a lunch break?

1771
01:26:53,797 --> 01:26:56,508
Yo, bust it,
ain't no need to discuss it

1772
01:26:56,592 --> 01:26:59,511
Just take this job and shove it
right between your buttocks

1773
01:26:59,595 --> 01:27:01,263
Take this job and shove it

1774
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:04,600
I ain't working here no more

1775
01:27:04,683 --> 01:27:06,477
Take this job and shove it

1776
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,646
I ain't working here no more

1777
01:27:09,730 --> 01:27:12,191
Take this job and shove it

1778
01:27:12,274 --> 01:27:15,110
I ain't working here no more

1779
01:27:15,194 --> 01:27:17,488
Take this job, take this job

1780
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:20,407
Take this job and shove it

1781
01:27:20,491 --> 01:27:22,284
Take this job and shove it

1782
01:27:22,367 --> 01:27:25,704
I ain't working here no more

1783
01:27:25,787 --> 01:27:28,081
A- a-ah a-a-a-a-ah

1784
01:27:28,165 --> 01:27:30,959
I ain't working here no more

1785
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:32,920
Take this job and shove it

1786
01:27:33,003 --> 01:27:36,298
I ain't working here no more

1787
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:40,427
Ay-ya ya-ya-ya,
I ain't working here no more

1788
01:27:40,511 --> 01:27:42,054
Just shove it

1789
01:27:43,722 --> 01:27:46,517
Canibus and the Biz

1790
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:48,936
Ah-aah aah-ah

1791
01:27:49,019 --> 01:27:52,648
It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

1792
01:27:54,483 --> 01:27:57,194
It's coming from
Canibus and the Biz

1793
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:03,320
From, from Canibus
and the Bi-i-i-

1794
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:10,320
