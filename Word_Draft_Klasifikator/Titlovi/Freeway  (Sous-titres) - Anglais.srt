2
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,532
Okay, we've got a four-word sentence
here for you.

3
00:02:59,532 --> 00:03:01,837
What is it, Vanessa ?

4
00:03:03,316 --> 00:03:05,796
Vanessa, come on.

5
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:09,449
Here we go. "The".

6
00:03:09,449 --> 00:03:11,406
"The" ?

7
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,713
"Ca-caa..."

8
00:03:18,713 --> 00:03:20,411
Caa...

9
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:27,804
"Cat."

10
00:03:27,804 --> 00:03:30,719
Perfect. You've got it.
Now let's continue to the third word.

11
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,284
"Dr..."

12
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,285
"Dr-en..."

13
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:37,721
Think "k", "kuh", followed by "s".

14
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:41,548
Think "kuh-s". "kuh-s".

15
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:43,549
Think.

16
00:03:43,549 --> 00:03:46,377
"Drenks" ?

17
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:49,160
- "Drinks" ?
- You got it. That's it.

18
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:52,726
- "Drinks".
- You did it. Perfect.

19
00:03:52,726 --> 00:03:56,597
Um, "The cat drinks...

20
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,165
milk."

21
00:04:02,121 --> 00:04:05,558
That's right. Very good.
Great, Vanessa.

22
00:04:11,169 --> 00:04:13,170
Vanessa ! Chopper !

23
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:18,693
Fully rewarded now ?

24
00:04:48,529 --> 00:04:52,184
Hey, mister !
I've got my own place.

25
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:55,273
It's right over there in the motel.

26
00:04:55,315 --> 00:04:57,882
You can turn right here and get in.
It's cooler.

27
00:04:57,925 --> 00:05:00,492
Then can I get in the car with you ?

28
00:05:00,492 --> 00:05:03,318
- I'll go wherever you wanna go.
- Move, bitch !

29
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:05,493
- No, thank you !
- Sir ! Sir !

30
00:05:05,537 --> 00:05:08,755
Well, screw you too,
fuckin' nigger !

31
00:05:08,755 --> 00:05:11,365
Mom ? What are you doin' ?

32
00:05:11,365 --> 00:05:15,018
- What are you doin' home so early ?
- It's not so early, Mom.

33
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:18,758
- How you doin', Ms. Lutz ?
- Don't even talk to her, Chopper !

34
00:05:18,758 --> 00:05:21,456
- Vanessa, I'm out of here.
- Okay.

35
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:25,326
- Will you give your mom my regards ?
- Will do, Ms. Lutz.

36
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:27,283
You said you weren't gonna
do this no more.

37
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,719
I've had enough crap
from your father all day.

38
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:32,111
- I am real stressed out...
- Larry is not my dad.

39
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:34,939
If you're gonna smart-ass me,
you can just go on home right now.

40
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:36,593
Get out of my face right now !

41
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:39,724
- Go on, get out !
- Fine.

42
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:42,725
- Fine.
- You don't know nothing' about nothin' !

43
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:46,292
You don't know
a goddamn thing about nothin' !

44
00:05:53,294 --> 00:05:55,556
Larry, just let me through.

45
00:05:57,121 --> 00:06:00,558
- What's the magic word ?
- Fuck you, you piece of shit.

46
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:03,298
"Fuck you" ?

47
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:17,781
How was school ?

48
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:21,305
Like you really
fuckin' care, asshole.

49
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:25,175
Me and your mama, we spent the whole day
in line securin' rent vouchers,

50
00:06:25,175 --> 00:06:27,917
and we could both use
a little consideration !

51
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:37,267
Don't it bother you your own wife
bringin' off all them guys for money ?

52
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:39,659
I make her use mouthwash after.

53
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:42,096
You like that minty-fresh taste,
huh, Larry ?

54
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:45,227
Vanessa Lutz, I'm gettin' ready
to take a seriously big shit

55
00:06:45,227 --> 00:06:47,488
right on top of that
pointy little head of yours !

56
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:49,575
Don't be a smart-ass.

57
00:06:51,272 --> 00:06:53,229
Hey, motherfucker.

58
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,579
- You want some company ?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:59,623 --> 00:07:01,580
Oh, let me get in.

60
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,668
<i>You get the luckiest breaks.</i>

61
00:07:03,668 --> 00:07:06,365
<i>And I mean lucky.
What else could it be ?</i>

62
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:10,149
<i>We interrupt this program to go live
to L.A. County Sheriff's headquarters,</i>

63
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,715
<i>where a press conference
is now in progress...</i>

64
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,021
<i>regarding the grisly find
yesterday morning</i>

65
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:17,413
<i>along San Diego Freeway
in Torrance.</i>

66
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:21,500
<i>The two females have been
identified as 19-year-old...</i>

67
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,633
<i>Tempest Mueller of Downey,
and 16-year-old...</i>

68
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:28,286
<i>Corky Poindexter of Bellflower.</i>

69
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:32,548
<i>Both females have extensive
arrest records for prostitution,</i>

70
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:36,115
<i>and we are now considering them
as victims of the individual</i>

71
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:40,595
<i>that we call the I-5 Killer.</i>

72
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:42,552
<i>I'll take a few questions.</i>

73
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:47,336
- I happened to be watchin' that, Larry !
- Forget it.

74
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,294
You just don't want me
hearin' about that killer out there.

75
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:54,340
But what if he drove up right
this second and snatched up Mom, huh ?

76
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:57,167
What would you have
to say then, smart guy ?

77
00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:00,298
First of all,
your mama would kick his ass.

78
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,692
And second of all, that killer
is all the way up in L.A., okay ?

79
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:30,223
<i>My dog's better than your dog</i>

80
00:08:30,223 --> 00:08:33,223
<i>My dog's better than yours</i>

81
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:35,963
<i>My dog's better
'cause he gets Ken-L Ration</i>

82
00:08:35,963 --> 00:08:39,096
<i>My dog's better than yours</i>

83
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:41,879
Larry, get your goddamn hands
off of my anatomy !

84
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:44,924
- Or I swear to fucking God...
- What ?

85
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:47,403
- What are you gonna do ?
- I'll tell Mom.

86
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:50,969
Oh, yeah, like she's
really gonna believe you.

87
00:08:50,969 --> 00:08:53,493
I'm really not up
to your shit today, Larry.

88
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,580
- Fact, I'm mad as hell at you now.
- Aw, come here.

89
00:08:56,624 --> 00:08:58,669
Goddamn it, Larry !

90
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:00,886
Get your fuckin' hands off me,
you shithead !

91
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:05,148
Fucker !

92
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:08,888
You hit hard !

93
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:15,152
Now you just behave.

94
00:09:15,152 --> 00:09:17,457
Fuck, you hit hard.

95
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:19,762
You know, I can't help you

96
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:22,459
if you don't tell me
what it is you want.

97
00:09:23,721 --> 00:09:26,419
Well, maybe we'd better
just forget the whole thing.

98
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:28,723
No.

99
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:31,550
I bet you like havin'
your wiener sucked.

100
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,378
- Hmm ? Don't you ?
- Yeah, I guess so.

101
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:39,031
How come that doesn't
surprise me ?

102
00:09:39,031 --> 00:09:42,163
What would a thing
like that cost ?

103
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,164
Thirty dollars.

104
00:09:47,165 --> 00:09:49,904
Sheriff's Department.
You're under arrest.

105
00:09:53,428 --> 00:09:55,298
Let go !

106
00:09:59,082 --> 00:10:01,691
Come on, guys, I didn't do anything.
I did nothing wrong.

107
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:04,171
- Take it easy.
- Come on.

108
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:07,085
Where do you think you're going ?

109
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:11,391
You're hurtin' me !
You're hurtin' my arm !

110
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,698
What's your name, Miss ?

111
00:10:16,698 --> 00:10:18,350
Ramona Lutz.

112
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:20,135
Bully !

113
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:25,049
- Stayin' at this motel ?
- Yeah.

114
00:10:27,441 --> 00:10:31,486
I never saw that before in my life,
and that's God's truth, sir.

115
00:10:31,486 --> 00:10:33,791
You're telling me this
brown residue isn't narcotics ?

116
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,879
It doesn't belong to me.

117
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,706
What is that ? Speed ?
You look like a speedy kind of gal.

118
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:40,793
Officer, please, listen to me.

119
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:42,750
My little girl...

120
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,840
she's home with me now, and she just
got out of Children's Services,

121
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,492
and I cannot afford to be busted again
because they'll take her away from me.

122
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:51,927
They'll just take my baby away.

123
00:10:51,927 --> 00:10:55,060
You know this pipe
constitutes probable cause,

124
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,452
so we're gonna have to take
a look inside your motel room.

125
00:10:57,452 --> 00:11:01,411
You can't do that.
My husband's asleep.

126
00:11:01,455 --> 00:11:04,759
- Your husband know you're soliciting ?
- Give us a fuckin' break.

127
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,934
- Your husband own a firearm, Ramona ?
- My Larry is on parole.

128
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:12,153
He hasn't had a firearm
for a long time.

129
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:14,590
We're gonna be real unhappy
if you're not tellin' us the truth.

130
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,634
I am tellin' you the truth, okay ?

131
00:11:16,677 --> 00:11:18,634
Come on. Let's go.

132
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:21,983
You guys are makin' me
wish I was dead.

133
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,158
You fuckin' happy about that ?
Are you fuckin' happy about that ?

134
00:11:26,158 --> 00:11:28,421
Cut that out right now
or you're gonna be hogtied !

135
00:11:28,463 --> 00:11:32,204
- But if you just listen to me !
- Shut your mouth now !

136
00:11:32,204 --> 00:11:34,291
Not another word !

137
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,514
Sheriff's Department, Larry.

138
00:11:44,514 --> 00:11:48,036
<i>- Oh, yes !
- We need to talk to you a minute.</i>

139
00:11:48,993 --> 00:11:50,951
Hey ! What the fuck !

140
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:54,387
- Oh, shit !
- Who's the girl, Larry ?

141
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,431
- Tryin' to take my baby away.
- You're diddlin' the daughter, Larry ?

142
00:11:57,431 --> 00:11:59,606
What kind of question is that ?

143
00:11:59,606 --> 00:12:02,650
- You mean...
- Get her outta here !

144
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,477
Hey, come on now.
She ain't my real daughter.

145
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:08,914
And besides,
nothin's goin' on, right ?

146
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:12,349
- Just who is this man to you ?
- He's my stepfather.

147
00:12:12,349 --> 00:12:14,655
Take him into the other room
and I'll talk to the juvenile.

148
00:12:14,655 --> 00:12:17,873
I got a pit in my shoulder,
and if you don't cuff me in front,

149
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:21,397
I'm gonna sue the police department
until there's no fuckin' tomorrow !

150
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,833
- You son of a bitch !
- What's your name ?

151
00:12:25,573 --> 00:12:27,573
Vanessa Lutz.

152
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:30,270
Well, kid, I sure don't envy
your situation here.

153
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:32,575
My parents is just goin' through
a hard time is all

154
00:12:32,575 --> 00:12:34,881
with the finances and everything.

155
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:38,534
Well, I see they still got
enough money left over to buy drugs.

156
00:12:38,534 --> 00:12:42,275
I wouldn't be comfortable talkin'
about that sort of thing, ma'am.

157
00:12:45,492 --> 00:12:49,060
I'm goin' to ask you a question, okay ?
Don't get upset. It's important.

158
00:12:51,886 --> 00:12:56,018
Is there some sort of sexual activity
between your stepfather and yourself ?

159
00:13:00,541 --> 00:13:03,239
- Elevator up.
- Come here, baby.

160
00:13:03,239 --> 00:13:06,240
- We are so fucked.
- What are you laughin' at ?

161
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:08,980
We are so fucked.

162
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,199
Oh, don't take my baby away !
Oh, please !

163
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:15,417
If you love her so much, how come
you don't clean up around here ?

164
00:13:15,417 --> 00:13:17,637
I do clean up, sir.

165
00:13:17,637 --> 00:13:20,115
It just happens that
I'm under a great deal of stress.

166
00:13:20,115 --> 00:13:23,028
My sister happened to die
three months ago in Washington,

167
00:13:23,072 --> 00:13:25,855
- and I'm tryin' to get off methadone !
- You're on methadone ?

168
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:28,682
Will you please
give me a cigarette ?

169
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,032
- I told you to keep quiet.
- Please give her a cigarette.

170
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,424
- Please.
- Are you mad at me ?

171
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:36,599
Honey ?

172
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:38,904
I'm not mad, Mom.

173
00:13:38,904 --> 00:13:42,862
Please don't be mad.
Come over here, give me a big hug.

174
00:13:42,862 --> 00:13:46,081
Come on. I ain't gonna see you
for a long time, baby.

175
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,560
Come on.

176
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,909
Oh, baby. Oh.

177
00:13:51,952 --> 00:13:54,518
I am so sorry, Pooh Bear.

178
00:13:54,562 --> 00:13:56,607
I'm so sorry.

179
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:01,087
You still love me ?

180
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:04,044
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you more.

181
00:14:08,828 --> 00:14:10,265
Here.

182
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,877
Would you get this...

183
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:24,791
Tell this piece of shit
to get his knee out of my neck !

184
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:28,531
Bye, Ramona !
I love you !

185
00:14:30,749 --> 00:14:32,706
I love you !

186
00:14:36,142 --> 00:14:38,970
Watch her head.

187
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:41,886
- I'll go in the other car.
- Get her outta here.

188
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:45,538
Bye, Ramona !

189
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:49,496
- Children's Services are on their way.
- Oh, that's just great.

190
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:52,106
No offense, kid, but anything's
an improvement over this.

191
00:14:55,672 --> 00:14:58,891
What do you think we ought to do ?
Just leave you here ?

192
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:04,110
I could stay with you
for a couple of weeks.

193
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,894
- Are you kidding ?
- No, I'm serious.

194
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,721
I could do all sorts of chores
while you was out messin' people up.

195
00:15:09,721 --> 00:15:12,243
We're not allowed
to do things like that.

196
00:15:14,635 --> 00:15:17,028
- You're lyin'.
- No, I'm not.

197
00:15:17,028 --> 00:15:21,422
If you don't want to, all you had to do
was just say it straight out.

198
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,682
I don't want to.

199
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:28,076
Okay, then.

200
00:15:40,516 --> 00:15:43,603
Hey, Mrs. Sheets.
Guess you heard the news.

201
00:15:43,603 --> 00:15:46,648
Hello, Vanessa. I heard your mother
might be away for awhile.

202
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:51,041
This is her third arrest this year.
She's lookin' at six months, mandatory.

203
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:54,129
We're holding the stepfather
on multiple parole violations.

204
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:57,390
Oh, I am so sorry
about all this, Vanessa.

205
00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:00,610
- I can take over here now, Officer.
- Good luck, kid.

206
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,263
Yeah, right. Come on over
and ruin my life again real soon.

207
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,568
You don't have to be
so hard on the officer.

208
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:09,786
She just took my whole family
off to jail, okay ?

209
00:16:14,616 --> 00:16:17,182
I hate pigs so much,
Mrs. Sheets.

210
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:25,228
Come on, now.
Let's go gather up some of your things.

211
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:28,056
You're puttin' me in foster care
again, aren't you ?

212
00:16:28,056 --> 00:16:32,752
Honey, I'm willing to consider any
alternative you'd like to suggest, but...

213
00:16:32,752 --> 00:16:35,362
My grandma would
be an alternative.

214
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:38,059
This is the first
I've heard of any grandma.

215
00:16:38,059 --> 00:16:41,582
On my father's side.
My real father. See ?

216
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:45,148
She'd take me in, most likely.

217
00:16:45,148 --> 00:16:47,540
You don't sound too sure.

218
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,846
Actually, she don't
know about me yet.

219
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:52,977
That's not gonna do us
much good for tonight.

220
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,936
Why haven't you been
in touch with her before now ?

221
00:16:56,936 --> 00:17:00,067
Before I was born, there was this
bad blood between her and my mom,

222
00:17:00,067 --> 00:17:02,850
and there must've been
some harsh words spoke...

223
00:17:02,894 --> 00:17:07,244
because my mom threw this chemical
on her face that burned her skin a bit.

224
00:17:07,897 --> 00:17:09,462
Lovely.

225
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:12,768
I tried gettin' her on the phone once,
but she ain't listed.

226
00:17:12,768 --> 00:17:15,681
If I could get up to Stockton,
I know I'd find her.

227
00:17:15,725 --> 00:17:18,944
- Just like that, huh ?
- Yeah.

228
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,946
Oh, my God.

229
00:17:23,946 --> 00:17:26,773
I know what I need.

230
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:30,078
Mrs. Sheets, could you come in here
and fold up my blanket ?

231
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:32,991
- This one ?
- Yeah, that one.

232
00:17:33,035 --> 00:17:36,342
- What do you want with this old thing ?
- My mama gave it to me.

233
00:17:36,342 --> 00:17:38,429
What are you doing ?
What... ?

234
00:17:40,212 --> 00:17:43,040
Oh, shit ! Sorry.
Let me get you turned around.

235
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,128
Vanessa, this is not funny !

236
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:50,130
I'm not laughin', Mrs. Sheets.

237
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,958
Now, if you yell loud enough,
Mr. Wong will come and set you free.

238
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:57,089
He's the day manager.
I'll leave the keys on top of the TV.

239
00:17:57,089 --> 00:17:59,481
Vanessa, you come back here !

240
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:37,365
Where the fuck are you, Chopper ?

241
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,109
Chopper !

242
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,112
Chopper, we're fucked.
We're totally fucked.

243
00:18:58,112 --> 00:19:01,548
Just after you left, the pigs came
and pinched Mom and Larry both.

244
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:03,940
Then my parole officer showed up
like the motherfuckin' plague

245
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,811
to take me off to foster care again,
just like last time.

246
00:19:10,638 --> 00:19:13,205
So how did you get here ?

247
00:19:13,248 --> 00:19:16,163
I cuffed her ankle to the bed.

248
00:19:16,163 --> 00:19:20,424
- That wasn't very smart, Vanessa.
- I know, I know.

249
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:24,687
I'm goin' up north, and unless you never
wanna see me again, you better get in.

250
00:19:24,687 --> 00:19:27,819
I gotta be in court next week
for sentencing.

251
00:19:27,819 --> 00:19:32,820
If I don't show, I'm gonna get
a year at Camp Gonzalez for sure.

252
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:37,127
I guess I'm on my own.

253
00:19:37,127 --> 00:19:39,302
Where up north are you goin' ?

254
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:42,302
My grandma's up in Stockton.

255
00:19:42,346 --> 00:19:45,260
- You got any money ?
- No.

256
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:56,481
Sell that when you get
where you're goin'.

257
00:19:56,525 --> 00:19:58,483
It's from Spain.

258
00:20:01,223 --> 00:20:03,179
I love you so much, Chopper.

259
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,355
I love you too, baby.

260
00:20:26,014 --> 00:20:27,580
Oh, here.

261
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:30,624
Take this.

262
00:20:36,975 --> 00:20:39,279
I gotta go.

263
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,854
Bye, Chopper,
my beloved boyfriend.

264
00:21:17,121 --> 00:21:18,774
Pinche, mirate.

265
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,151
Damn fucking car.

266
00:22:37,195 --> 00:22:39,717
Didn't know that
today it would pass.

267
00:22:45,457 --> 00:22:46,893
Fuck.

268
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:09,729
You havin' some kind of trouble ?

269
00:23:09,729 --> 00:23:12,773
The fucking cocksucker
won't even fucking turn over !

270
00:23:15,253 --> 00:23:18,297
- Excuse my bad language, sir.
- It's all right.

271
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:21,516
- Would you mind if I take a look ?
- Go for it.

272
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:25,082
Get behind the wheel there
and step on the gas for me.

273
00:23:29,128 --> 00:23:30,606
Try it.

274
00:23:34,564 --> 00:23:35,912
Again.

275
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:46,569
I hate to break the news to you,
but this car's had it.

276
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:49,701
- I knew it was only a matter of time.
- Where are you headed ?

277
00:23:49,701 --> 00:23:51,875
My grandma's up in Stockton.

278
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:55,311
Well, I'm goin' as far as L.A.
You're welcome to ride with me.

279
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:57,313
- Really, mister ?
- Sure.

280
00:23:57,313 --> 00:24:00,530
- Grab your stuff and let's go.
- Thanks !

281
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:30,019
I guess we oughta call a tow truck.

282
00:24:30,063 --> 00:24:34,413
<i>Nah. Caltrans will take care of it.
My mom used to work part-time for them.</i>

283
00:24:34,413 --> 00:24:38,066
- So what do I call you ?
- Sorry. My name is Bob Wolverton.

284
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:41,285
- I'm Vanessa Lutz.
- It's nice to meet you, Vanessa.

285
00:24:41,328 --> 00:24:43,808
Put on your safety belt
and we'll get goin'.

286
00:24:47,895 --> 00:24:49,331
Great.

287
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:00,596
What's this all about ?

288
00:25:00,596 --> 00:25:03,422
It's a psychological manual.
I use it in my work.

289
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:06,729
I'm a counselor at a school
for boys with emotional trouble.

290
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:09,469
Just boys, huh ?
No girls at all ?

291
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:11,426
I'm afraid so.

292
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:17,473
So how does your family feel about
this trip of yours up to Stockton ?

293
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:20,300
I don't got no family
just at the moment.

294
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,910
Vanessa, everybody's got a family.

295
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:25,606
Shows how much you know.

296
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:29,998
- You wanna talk about it ?
- Not really.

297
00:25:29,998 --> 00:25:31,652
I'm sorry.

298
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,827
It's an unfortunate habit of mine,
sticking my nose where it shouldn't be.

299
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:38,045
That's a bad habit.

300
00:25:38,045 --> 00:25:41,350
Well, don't rub it in, okay ?
It's just my work.

301
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:45,831
I see a kid who looks like they're in
trouble, and I start askin' questions.

302
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,353
I guess it's just
become second nature.

303
00:25:48,353 --> 00:25:50,659
It's that obvious ?

304
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:54,181
- What is ?
- Me being in trouble.

305
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:56,922
Look, the offer's still open
if you want it.

306
00:25:58,792 --> 00:26:01,708
You know,
I've always found it amazing how...

307
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:04,839
how much easier it is to really share
something with a perfect stranger...

308
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,317
stuff that you couldn't even
talk to with your friends or family.

309
00:26:07,361 --> 00:26:09,014
I noticed that.

310
00:26:09,014 --> 00:26:11,406
- That's real funny.
- Yeah, it is.

311
00:26:11,406 --> 00:26:14,755
Most of the kids I work with, I don't
press 'em to talk about themselves.

312
00:26:14,755 --> 00:26:16,929
I just let them know I'm there,

313
00:26:16,929 --> 00:26:20,061
and that they can talk
about themselves if they want to.

314
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:28,412
I guess my biggest problem
right now is...

315
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:30,152
my mama's in jail.

316
00:26:31,413 --> 00:26:34,544
Vanessa, that sounds like
a pretty bad situation.

317
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:37,154
Yeah, but that's why
I'm goin' to see my grandma.

318
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:43,113
Would you mind me asking
why your mother's in jail ?

319
00:26:43,113 --> 00:26:44,852
It's pretty embarrassing.

320
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,159
Why would you be embarrassed
about another person's acts ?

321
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,463
I don't know, it's just...

322
00:26:49,463 --> 00:26:52,814
I mean, I don't feel comfortable
talkin' about stuff like that

323
00:26:52,814 --> 00:26:57,380
'cause I think it makes me
look like a low-type person.

324
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,424
Well, I can understand that.

325
00:27:00,424 --> 00:27:04,251
Most of the boys I work with,
even the most troubled ones...

326
00:27:04,295 --> 00:27:07,079
all they really need is just
someone to listen to 'em.

327
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:13,037
Yeah, but you probably get so sick
of hearin' them sad stories every day.

328
00:27:13,037 --> 00:27:15,647
I don't.
I really love my work.

329
00:27:15,647 --> 00:27:19,997
I couldn't imagine myself
doing anything else. Not ever.

330
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:28,348
Guess I wouldn't mind
talkin' to someone.

331
00:27:30,652 --> 00:27:32,958
I just wouldn't know
where to begin.

332
00:27:34,308 --> 00:27:37,830
Why don't you begin with your mother ?
I mean, if you want to.

333
00:27:39,961 --> 00:27:42,005
My mama's a whore.

334
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:52,662
Thanks, mister.

335
00:27:52,662 --> 00:27:54,618
I mean, Bob.

336
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:56,837
There.

337
00:27:58,315 --> 00:28:01,230
I can't believe
I'm tellin' you all this stuff.

338
00:28:03,709 --> 00:28:06,536
My mama's in jail.

339
00:28:06,536 --> 00:28:10,493
It looks like my stepfather's next
parole officer ain't even been born yet.

340
00:28:12,494 --> 00:28:15,279
Vanessa, you really
don't have anyone, do you ?

341
00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:22,064
That's terrible.

342
00:28:23,325 --> 00:28:26,239
Oh, that's just terrible.

343
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:29,371
My real dad was this
merchant marine out of Texas,

344
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:32,199
but he got stabbed to death
on one of them container ships...

345
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:35,634
by this man from Pakistan
before I was born.

346
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:38,330
You wanna see his picture
I got right here ?

347
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:39,983
Absolutely.

348
00:28:42,724 --> 00:28:44,681
That's my daddy.

349
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,421
- He looks very interesting.
- You think ?

350
00:28:50,421 --> 00:28:54,206
- Absolutely.
- I think so, too.

351
00:28:54,206 --> 00:28:56,250
Your grandmother's gonna be very proud

352
00:28:56,294 --> 00:28:59,207
when she finds out what
a wonderful granddaughter she's got.

353
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,339
But I have to be honest with you.

354
00:29:02,339 --> 00:29:04,732
I think given
your present situation,

355
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:07,951
maybe foster care would be
the way you should go right now.

356
00:29:07,951 --> 00:29:12,127
Bob, sometimes them places are okay,
but most of the time,

357
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:15,779
them people are just in it for the check
that the state sends for your upkeep.

358
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,171
I take it you've had
some bad experiences.

359
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:21,912
The last one I was in, there was an old
man that everyone called "grandpa",

360
00:29:21,912 --> 00:29:26,088
<i>and he had this disease called
Wisenheimers, I think it was...</i>

361
00:29:26,088 --> 00:29:29,654
where your brain cells
run out into your pee.

362
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:34,960
- It's a form of senility.
- Here's your check, sir.

363
00:29:35,918 --> 00:29:39,876
Thanks, Bob. That's the best
fuckin' dinner I've had all month.

364
00:29:42,354 --> 00:29:45,616
I wouldn't mind stretchin' my legs
before I got behind the wheel. You mind ?

365
00:29:47,573 --> 00:29:50,098
No. Sure.
I got all the time in the world.

366
00:29:50,098 --> 00:29:50,924
Great.

367
00:29:52,577 --> 00:29:55,186
So them foster parents,
the Moraleses...

368
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:58,013
you would've thought a check
from the state would've been enough.

369
00:29:58,013 --> 00:30:01,014
But no, they figured on me
helpin' out with Grandpa, too.

370
00:30:01,058 --> 00:30:04,495
- You had to provide care for this man ?
- Get crucial.

371
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:07,191
This guy was pissin' his sheets
nearly every night.

372
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:10,409
Just bein' near him
made me want to puke my guts out.

373
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,714
So what happened
when you refused ?

374
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:16,237
They just started treatin' me like I was
the biggest bitch who'd ever been born.

375
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,152
Then this one night, just a couple weeks
after I'd been placed there,

376
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:24,370
I woke up to see Grandpa standin'
over me with his cane in one hand...

377
00:30:24,414 --> 00:30:26,806
and his you-know-what
in the other.

378
00:30:26,806 --> 00:30:28,676
My God.
What happened ?

379
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:32,504
- I told him to get the hell out.
- I take it he didn't.

380
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:35,767
No. That's when he tried to
slip it under the covers with me,

381
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,463
and I just went crazy on him.

382
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:41,072
What do you mean,
you went crazy ?

383
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:43,464
I was pissed off
'cause I couldn't see my mom,

384
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:46,510
and havin' this perv standin' over me
waggin' his thing in my face

385
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,467
was just the last straw.

386
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,772
So what did you do ?

387
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:53,077
Well, I got up on my knees,

388
00:30:53,077 --> 00:30:56,817
and just slapped his dentures
half out of his face.

389
00:30:56,817 --> 00:31:00,036
And then I dropped down on his chest
and just started whalin' on him,

390
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,602
beatin' him up so hard
and swearin' so loud.

391
00:31:03,602 --> 00:31:05,169
My God.

392
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,604
So then the lights went on, and
Mr. Morales showed up in his pajamas.

393
00:31:08,604 --> 00:31:12,258
- Well, thank God he was there.
- Yeah, right.

394
00:31:12,258 --> 00:31:16,956
Hit me so hard, I had to have my jaw
wired shut for nearly three months.

395
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:20,827
Broke my nose, too.
That's how come it's so big.

396
00:31:23,741 --> 00:31:26,526
Your nose is not big.

397
00:31:27,612 --> 00:31:29,874
It's pretty damn big.

398
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:34,658
Was this man ever punished ?

399
00:31:34,702 --> 00:31:39,269
Are you kidding ?
A pillar of society like Mr. Morales ?

400
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:42,923
No. But my mom got out of rehab
a couple days later

401
00:31:42,923 --> 00:31:45,531
so I didn't have to
go back or nothin'.

402
00:31:45,531 --> 00:31:50,403
You were telling me a little while ago
that your stepdad was on parole.

403
00:31:50,446 --> 00:31:54,187
Oh, yeah.
Larry's been in lots of pens

404
00:31:54,187 --> 00:31:58,145
like this one federal place
up in Illinois, Marion.

405
00:31:58,145 --> 00:32:00,624
It's just mostly for drug shit.

406
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:05,322
Manufacturing methamphetamines,
stolen property...

407
00:32:05,322 --> 00:32:07,541
but nothin' real, real bad.

408
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:13,065
Vanessa, please don't be offended
by my next question...

409
00:32:13,065 --> 00:32:15,022
but...

410
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:19,633
did your stepfather molest you ?

411
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:23,894
Oh, my God.

412
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:31,287
This policewoman just asked me that
very same question just a few hours ago.

413
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:35,072
And how did that make you feel ?

414
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:39,638
Like I got "Daddy's Fuckhole"
tattooed on my forehead.

415
00:32:39,638 --> 00:32:42,248
Maybe this is an issue
you should explore.

416
00:32:44,249 --> 00:32:47,382
I never even told my fiance
about this stuff.

417
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,687
Vanessa, if you keep something
like this bottled up inside,

418
00:32:50,687 --> 00:32:52,558
it could wreck your whole life.

419
00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:55,906
Now you're scarin' me.

420
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:58,125
That's not my intention.

421
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,604
I just think you have a very good
opportunity now to get through

422
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:04,475
some of the trauma and anguish you've
been suffering from for a long time.

423
00:33:05,736 --> 00:33:08,128
I do got trauma, huh ?

424
00:33:08,128 --> 00:33:10,607
Let's not kid ourselves, Vanessa.

425
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:14,696
I've been so anguished...

426
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:17,480
I can't even remember bein' happy.

427
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:21,046
Vanessa, you have to
look this pain in the eye.

428
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:24,090
Otherwise it could rule over
every aspect of your life.

429
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,614
Now, I think I can help you

430
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:29,919
but you're going
to have to trust me.

431
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:34,268
You're going to
have to let me in.

432
00:33:38,139 --> 00:33:40,445
My God, you're cold.

433
00:33:40,445 --> 00:33:43,359
Just thinkin' about
my fucked-up life is all.

434
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:52,841
Let's go.

435
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,538
I'm sorry.

436
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:01,713
Here I am, blubberin' like a big old
baby, and you're just tryin' to help me.

437
00:34:01,713 --> 00:34:04,932
Vanessa, Vanessa,
just take your time.

438
00:34:04,975 --> 00:34:07,020
Take your time.

439
00:34:15,371 --> 00:34:17,980
I was 11 when Larry first held me.

440
00:34:20,894 --> 00:34:22,984
Where was your mother ?

441
00:34:22,984 --> 00:34:25,593
Some stupid halfway house.

442
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:31,030
How did the abuse begin ?

443
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:35,510
With my mama gone, I had all these
extra chores that I had to do,

444
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,207
like the laundry and the groceries
and things like that.

445
00:34:38,207 --> 00:34:40,207
So you became
the woman of the house.

446
00:34:40,207 --> 00:34:42,512
Yeah.

447
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:46,034
Yeah, and I was
so proud of myself.

448
00:34:47,904 --> 00:34:51,254
And then this one night,
we were just watchin' TV after dinner

449
00:34:51,254 --> 00:34:53,864
like we always do,

450
00:34:53,864 --> 00:34:56,255
and that's when Larry told me...

451
00:34:56,255 --> 00:35:01,171
that one of Mama's chores had always
been to massage his you-know-what.

452
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:06,259
Did Larry expose himself to you ?

453
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:08,870
All through the show.

454
00:35:09,523 --> 00:35:12,088
Did Larry have an erection ?

455
00:35:12,132 --> 00:35:14,610
That's puttin' it mildly.

456
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:18,874
Did he ask you to perform
oral sex for him ?

457
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,614
At first, I mean, he just had me
hold on to his you-know-what

458
00:35:24,614 --> 00:35:27,745
durin' whatever
happened to be on TV.

459
00:35:27,745 --> 00:35:32,139
He didn't get around to the other thing
you just mentioned for a while.

460
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,662
I guess he figured
if he went all slow-like,

461
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:38,793
I wouldn't freak-out
and get him in trouble.

462
00:35:38,793 --> 00:35:42,229
But back then, I didn't even know
that stuff we was doin' was criminal.

463
00:35:42,229 --> 00:35:46,100
Vanessa, victims often blame themselves.
It's a common occurrence.

464
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:50,580
But make no mistake about it :
you are the victim.

465
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,930
- Really, Bob ?
- Absolutely.

466
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:58,846
I was such a baby, I didn't even know
why men wanted that stuff done to them.

467
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:01,542
Vanessa, my God, you were a child.

468
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,847
You must have been so confused.

469
00:36:03,847 --> 00:36:06,326
You know, and...

470
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:10,718
and when he did that thing
that you mentioned for the first time...

471
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:15,721
I swear to Christ, I thought he was
goin' to the bathroom in my mouth.

472
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:26,030
Do I have your absolute trust ?

473
00:36:27,073 --> 00:36:31,465
I guess I trust you more than I've ever
trusted anyone in my whole life, Bob.

474
00:36:31,465 --> 00:36:34,597
And I really mean that.

475
00:36:34,597 --> 00:36:37,512
Thank you.
The reason why I'm asking...

476
00:36:37,512 --> 00:36:41,775
there's this powerful new psychological
technique that I'd like to try on you.

477
00:36:41,818 --> 00:36:43,776
I think it could really help you.

478
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,863
Would you like to give it a try ?

479
00:36:45,863 --> 00:36:47,646
Yeah, sure.

480
00:36:47,646 --> 00:36:49,907
It consists of
a battery of questions

481
00:36:49,951 --> 00:36:53,475
that are designed to trigger
certain elements of your subconscious.

482
00:36:53,475 --> 00:36:55,649
I've gotta warn you, Vanessa...

483
00:36:55,649 --> 00:36:59,215
this technique,
it can be uncomfortable.

484
00:36:59,738 --> 00:37:01,521
Go for it, Bob.

485
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:04,304
I mean, if you think
it's gonna help me.

486
00:37:05,783 --> 00:37:09,219
Okay. Let's get started.
Are you ready ?

487
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:13,699
A few moments ago, you were
telling me that you felt like

488
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:15,568
Larry had gone to the bathroom
in your mouth.

489
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:18,483
Those were your exact words.
Do you remember ?

490
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:21,615
Now at that exact moment,
when Larry ejaculated in your mouth,

491
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:24,355
did you feel as though somehow
you were being transformed...

492
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:27,488
into some kind of a human urinal ?

493
00:37:27,488 --> 00:37:30,271
What kind of fucking questions
are these, Bob ?

494
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:32,794
You have to answer with the first thing
that comes into your mind.

495
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:35,403
It's very important.

496
00:37:35,403 --> 00:37:37,795
- I knew I was flesh and blood.
- I understand that.

497
00:37:37,795 --> 00:37:40,622
But you have to tell me
exactly how you felt.

498
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:44,797
You have to learn how to express
your feelings out loud.

499
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:51,235
I felt just like you said.

500
00:37:54,149 --> 00:37:57,497
Say it out loud, Vanessa.

501
00:38:00,413 --> 00:38:03,544
I felt like I had been

502
00:38:03,544 --> 00:38:06,588
transformed into a human urinal.

503
00:38:15,853 --> 00:38:19,724
That's very good, Vanessa.
Very good.

504
00:38:20,637 --> 00:38:24,204
Now tell me this,
and this is absolutely crucial.

505
00:38:24,204 --> 00:38:25,856
Are you ready ?

506
00:38:32,338 --> 00:38:34,121
Did Larry try to fuck you ?

507
00:38:36,078 --> 00:38:37,557
Oh, God.

508
00:38:37,557 --> 00:38:40,035
He tried, later on.

509
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,778
Did you like it
when Larry fucked you ?

510
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:51,431
You piece of shit !

511
00:38:52,562 --> 00:38:56,826
- I told you this can get uncomfortable.
- Pull on over right now !

512
00:38:56,826 --> 00:38:58,826
- We're not finished yet.
- Yes, we are !

513
00:38:58,826 --> 00:39:01,523
We are definitely finished.
Now you pull on over !

514
00:39:01,523 --> 00:39:04,436
You can suffer irreparable damage
if you break it off like this !

515
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:07,481
- I don't give a goddamn !
- Jesus Christ !

516
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:10,483
Piece of shit !
Fuckin' pervert !

517
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:12,875
- Jesus Christ !
- Where's the door handle ?

518
00:39:12,919 --> 00:39:15,397
You lookin' for this ?

519
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,963
- Now you just settle down !
- I'm gonna kill you !

520
00:39:18,963 --> 00:39:22,923
I'm gonna slit your fuckin' throat.
Is that what you want me to fuckin' do ?

521
00:39:22,923 --> 00:39:25,010
Okay ! I'm stoppin', okay ?

522
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:27,923
You get down on the floor
and get my fuckin' car keys

523
00:39:27,923 --> 00:39:30,532
and you put them in the ignition.

524
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:33,968
You know, you wouldn't like it
if someone was doin' that to you.

525
00:39:33,968 --> 00:39:35,926
You're probably right, Vanessa.

526
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:38,971
- I doubt I would like it.
- Then stop it !

527
00:39:38,971 --> 00:39:41,799
I will stop it
if you promise to behave.

528
00:39:41,799 --> 00:39:43,452
I promise I'll behave.

529
00:39:47,627 --> 00:39:51,064
- Are you that guy on the news ?
- I'm sorry ?

530
00:39:51,064 --> 00:39:54,107
Are you the guy that's been killin'
all them girls on the freeway ?

531
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,370
Why are you killin'
all them girls, Bob ?

532
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,241
'Cause I've reached my fucking limit
with people like you, Vanessa.

533
00:40:02,241 --> 00:40:05,459
- What kind of people am I ?
- The alcoholics, the drug addicts...

534
00:40:05,459 --> 00:40:07,851
the fathers who fuck
their daughters...

535
00:40:07,851 --> 00:40:10,461
the drug-addicted motherfuckin' whores
with their bastard...

536
00:40:10,461 --> 00:40:13,070
Hey, I ain't no trick baby !

537
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:17,986
I call them "garbage people",
and I assure you, you are one of them.

538
00:40:17,986 --> 00:40:19,552
I am not.

539
00:40:19,552 --> 00:40:23,162
Look at you. You're already a master
at the manipulation of men.

540
00:40:23,205 --> 00:40:24,728
I didn't run nothin' on you.

541
00:40:24,772 --> 00:40:28,382
It's so intrinsic to your fuckin' nature,
you're not even aware when you do it.

542
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:33,514
Stupid bitch.

543
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:45,301
What, you think it's okay to do
all sorts of bad stuff to me now ?

544
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:49,780
That's an open-ended discussion, dealing
with deep philosophical ramifications...

545
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,086
something you could hardly grasp.

546
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:56,740
Take it from me, a professional,
you're an absolute fucking moron.

547
00:40:56,783 --> 00:40:59,350
You know,
maybe I ain't smart like you,

548
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:02,481
and maybe I haven't finished school,
but at least I ain't a hypocrite.

549
00:41:04,177 --> 00:41:07,700
Vanessa, please indulge me.
Tell me why I am a hypocrite.

550
00:41:09,178 --> 00:41:11,659
You act like you's all on
some sort of mission,

551
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:15,443
but all you wanna do is
just get off in a sex-type way.

552
00:41:18,139 --> 00:41:19,922
Are you gonna do sex to me now ?

553
00:41:22,401 --> 00:41:25,665
I promise you, if we get really,
really intimate,

554
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:28,578
you're gonna be
way past being offended.

555
00:41:30,448 --> 00:41:33,058
What, are you gonna
fuck me when I'm dead ?

556
00:41:35,885 --> 00:41:39,843
Mister, I'm a person !
I'm a human being !

557
00:41:39,843 --> 00:41:43,148
Yeah, like that drug addict
fuckin' whore of a mother of yours ?

558
00:41:43,192 --> 00:41:45,758
I sure wouldn't want
to meet your mom, Bob.

559
00:41:48,063 --> 00:41:51,195
What, you can talk about my mom
but I can't talk about yours ?

560
00:41:51,195 --> 00:41:53,891
We are not here
to talk about me, Vanessa !

561
00:41:53,935 --> 00:41:58,067
We are here to talk about you,
so get your fuckin' pants down !

562
00:41:58,067 --> 00:42:00,068
Please just let me go, Bob.

563
00:42:00,068 --> 00:42:01,503
Goddamn it !

564
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:05,375
Get your fuckin' pants down,
you fuckin' cunt !

565
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:06,941
What'd you call me ?

566
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,941
Get your fuckin' pants down now !

567
00:42:10,724 --> 00:42:12,986
Okay, but look, I got these boots

568
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:16,421
and I got all them laces and stuff,
so give me a minute.

569
00:42:16,421 --> 00:42:18,292
Hurry up.

570
00:42:24,773 --> 00:42:26,425
Fucking bitch !

571
00:42:26,469 --> 00:42:28,948
I'm gonna fuckin'
kill you, Vanessa.

572
00:42:28,948 --> 00:42:31,253
- You just settle down, Bob.
- Okay.

573
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:33,863
You just settle down right now !

574
00:42:33,863 --> 00:42:36,125
Drop that razor out the window.

575
00:42:36,169 --> 00:42:39,256
If you try anything,
I'm gonna shoot you so many times !

576
00:42:42,302 --> 00:42:46,695
You should've just let me out of the car
when I asked you to, Bob !

577
00:42:46,695 --> 00:42:48,870
You see where
bad manners get you ?

578
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,566
Listen, Vanessa, look.
I just...

579
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:54,393
I've heard all I'm gonna
hear out of you.

580
00:42:54,393 --> 00:42:56,698
- Fuck !
- So there !

581
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,090
Jesus Christ !

582
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:03,484
That's for trickin' me into tellin' you
all them things I never told my fiance !

583
00:43:04,528 --> 00:43:07,224
Jesus Christ !
We're gonna get into an accident !

584
00:43:07,224 --> 00:43:10,355
And that's for cuttin' off
all my hair, you fucker !

585
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:13,357
Vanessa, you're upset, okay ?
You have every right to be.

586
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,749
Something dark and terrible came
over me, but I wasn't gonna hurt you.

587
00:43:17,749 --> 00:43:20,967
- You gotta believe that.
- Yeah, right ! I'm so sure !

588
00:43:21,011 --> 00:43:25,360
I'm serious. I just wanted to scare you.
I don't even know why.

589
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:29,102
Vanessa, it's obvious to me right now
I'm a profoundly sick man.

590
00:43:29,146 --> 00:43:31,190
I won't argue with you there.

591
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:35,495
Anyone who'd do sex to a dead person
is definitely sick, mister.

592
00:43:35,495 --> 00:43:37,670
See ? You just admitted it.
I'm a sick...

593
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:40,194
Bob, shut up !
Shut up !

594
00:43:45,934 --> 00:43:47,978
Son of a bitch.

595
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:55,285
Vanessa ? What are you
thinking right now ?

596
00:43:55,285 --> 00:43:58,026
You wanna hear more of my
innermost fuckin' secrets ?

597
00:43:58,026 --> 00:43:59,765
- No.
- Fuckin' asshole.

598
00:43:59,765 --> 00:44:02,679
No. I was just wondering
what you were planning on doing.

599
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:06,462
I'm gonna turn you in to the
fuckin' pigs, that's what I'm gonna do !

600
00:44:10,334 --> 00:44:12,901
You know what'll happen then,
don't you ?

601
00:44:12,945 --> 00:44:16,467
Yeah. You'll end up
suckin' gas at San Quentin.

602
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:19,294
- Vanessa.
- You just might.

603
00:44:19,294 --> 00:44:23,993
Vanessa, people like me,
we don't go to the gas chamber.

604
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:26,689
Then you'll go to the penitentiary,
where the mighty Aryan Brotherhood

605
00:44:26,689 --> 00:44:28,777
will make you wish
you'd never been born.

606
00:44:28,777 --> 00:44:33,778
The likelihood of someone like me
goin' to prison is absolutely nil.

607
00:44:33,778 --> 00:44:36,171
You think they're
just goin' to let you walk ?

608
00:44:36,171 --> 00:44:39,606
It'll be like that time
Mr. Morales broke your jaw.

609
00:44:39,606 --> 00:44:42,738
- You think so, huh ?
- Absolutely.

610
00:44:42,738 --> 00:44:46,478
They won't take me for a killer.
They'll let me go free.

611
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:48,915
They'll send you to
some new foster home...

612
00:44:48,915 --> 00:44:52,872
probably make Mr. Morales' place
look like some pleasant dream to you.

613
00:44:54,438 --> 00:44:59,136
Unless, of course, you wanna play it
smart for the first time in your life.

614
00:44:59,136 --> 00:45:02,137
How do I go about doin' that, Bob ?

615
00:45:02,137 --> 00:45:04,834
I got some money on me.
I got an A.T.M. card.

616
00:45:04,878 --> 00:45:08,618
We can go get some more.
You can go your way, I'll go mine.

617
00:45:08,618 --> 00:45:11,749
I swear to God,
you'll never see or hear me again.

618
00:45:12,663 --> 00:45:14,750
What do you say ?

619
00:45:15,925 --> 00:45:18,926
I say, turn off
on that exit up there !

620
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:21,101
Vanessa, we're in
the middle of nowhere !

621
00:45:21,144 --> 00:45:23,927
You wanna get shot
a whole bunch of times ?

622
00:45:23,927 --> 00:45:26,842
Now do like I tell you, dumbass !

623
00:45:26,842 --> 00:45:31,235
- Okay, I'm turning.
- You think this is a game ?

624
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:48,242
What are we gonna do, Vanessa ?
Drive around forever looking for a cop ?

625
00:45:48,242 --> 00:45:51,895
Keep flappin' your gums, Bob.
Who cares if no one's listenin' ?

626
00:45:51,895 --> 00:45:54,374
Pull up on that
dirt road over there.

627
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:15,773
I know there's a lot of sick guys
that get hard...

628
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,948
thinkin' about messin' women up.

629
00:46:17,948 --> 00:46:21,296
Hell, that's all
you ever see on TV.

630
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:25,472
But when a guy goes and does that for
real like you were plannin' on doin'...

631
00:46:25,472 --> 00:46:29,736
- I was just trying to scare you.
- You had your turn to talk !

632
00:46:29,736 --> 00:46:32,128
I think it's only fair to let me
get my two cents in.

633
00:46:32,128 --> 00:46:35,041
You're absolutely right. Sorry.
Please, go on.

634
00:46:36,433 --> 00:46:39,740
But when a guy goes and hurts someone
who never hurt them,

635
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,306
that makes him a criminal first
and a sick guy second.

636
00:46:43,306 --> 00:46:46,611
It's like being sick has to take
second place to being crooked.

637
00:46:46,654 --> 00:46:49,220
And Bob, you're crooked.

638
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:52,483
You proved that to me tonight.

639
00:46:52,483 --> 00:46:56,528
- Am I making any sense ?
- Yes. There's so much I wanna tell you...

640
00:46:56,528 --> 00:47:00,398
- Bob.
- There's more to me than what you saw.

641
00:47:00,398 --> 00:47:02,181
- Bob.
- Please.

642
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:04,792
The time for talk's over now.

643
00:47:07,401 --> 00:47:11,141
I'm gonna ask you a question
and it's real, real important, okay ?

644
00:47:11,141 --> 00:47:12,708
What ?

645
00:47:14,187 --> 00:47:17,493
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and personal Savior ?

646
00:47:17,493 --> 00:47:20,537
Oh, my God ! Vanessa,
you're really scaring me.

647
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,538
Tell me now, Bob.
I need to know.

648
00:47:25,104 --> 00:47:28,757
Do you believe that Jesus Christ
is your Lord and personal Savior ?

649
00:47:29,496 --> 00:47:32,498
Yes. Yes, I do.
I swear.

650
00:47:32,542 --> 00:47:35,630
Good. That's really good.

651
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,779
Oh, God, not like this.

652
00:49:00,009 --> 00:49:02,010
Oh, God.

653
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,923
Dear God,
that was so fuckin' bad.

654
00:49:04,923 --> 00:49:08,448
But I was at a loss,
so I left it up to You.

655
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:13,753
I love You with all my heart and I hope
You don't hate me more than You do.

656
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,798
Please bless Mama, Larry
and Chopper.

657
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:20,364
Amen.

658
00:50:24,606 --> 00:50:27,521
<i>- Yeah, sure thing. Regular ?
- Yeah.</i>

659
00:50:27,521 --> 00:50:29,782
<i>Be right back.</i>

660
00:50:29,782 --> 00:50:32,392
<i>My God ! Did you see...</i>

661
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:42,309
<i>What the hell ?</i>

662
00:50:45,744 --> 00:50:48,441
I think I'll have the
"Double He-Man Breakfast"...

663
00:50:48,485 --> 00:50:52,095
and a large size cherry cola.

664
00:50:56,618 --> 00:50:58,054
What ?

665
00:51:00,882 --> 00:51:04,230
I must look a fright.
Got a washroom ?

666
00:51:16,713 --> 00:51:22,149
<i>Dr. Barnes, 4721.</i>

667
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:29,761
<i>Dr. Kenseno to I.C.U.</i>

668
00:51:32,588 --> 00:51:34,545
<i>Nurse Bowman to the Nursery.</i>

669
00:51:34,545 --> 00:51:36,633
One moment, please.

670
00:51:41,548 --> 00:51:43,114
Please.

671
00:51:43,723 --> 00:51:45,593
Call the police.

672
00:51:45,637 --> 00:51:47,377
Help me.

673
00:51:47,377 --> 00:51:48,421
Call...

674
00:51:48,551 --> 00:51:51,771
my wife, please.

675
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:02,730
- Freeze ! Police !
- Hi, Officer. What's up ?

676
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:06,036
- Let's go ! Come on.
- Sir, I did nothin' wrong.

677
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:08,342
- Shut up.
- I did nothin' wrong !

678
00:52:08,342 --> 00:52:10,342
We got a gun !
We got a gun.

679
00:52:10,342 --> 00:52:12,820
- Big wow.
- Back inside, sir.

680
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,779
God, half the goddamn world's got a gun.
You're gonna throw me in this car...

681
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:18,345
Enough !

682
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,780
Give me a goddamn break.

683
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,739
What ? What, you're not even
goin' to speak to me, Mr. Oink Man ?

684
00:52:26,608 --> 00:52:29,522
- I bet you like snatching girls.
- Back it up.

685
00:52:32,003 --> 00:52:34,744
Mr. Wolverton.

686
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:39,744
Mr. Wolverton's just learned he's going
to have to undergo a radical colectomy.

687
00:52:39,744 --> 00:52:41,397
That's rough.

688
00:52:41,397 --> 00:52:43,702
Yeah ? Jesus.

689
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:47,878
There's detectives from the sheriff's
department who need to speak to you.

690
00:52:47,878 --> 00:52:51,314
As soon as we finish
our neurologic test.

691
00:52:51,314 --> 00:52:52,575
Mr. Wolverton ?

692
00:52:52,575 --> 00:52:55,793
Mr. Wolverton ? Mr. Wolverton,
can you hear me ?

693
00:52:55,793 --> 00:52:58,925
I'm Garnet Wallace
from the sheriff's department.

694
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:02,057
I know you're in a lot of pain,
but can you take a moment ?

695
00:53:02,057 --> 00:53:07,145
I wanna show you a photograph. Tell me
if this is the person that shot you.

696
00:53:07,145 --> 00:53:10,060
Is this the person that shot you ?

697
00:53:10,102 --> 00:53:11,451
- Yes !
- Are you sure ?

698
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:14,757
This is the person that shot you ?

699
00:53:14,757 --> 00:53:17,585
Okay. You'll be all right.

700
00:53:20,716 --> 00:53:22,804
Oh, God ! Please !

701
00:53:22,804 --> 00:53:26,675
Give me the fuckin' morphine !
Oh, please !

702
00:53:26,675 --> 00:53:29,981
Mrs. Wolverton, your husband
gave a positive identification.

703
00:53:30,025 --> 00:53:31,764
What happens now ?

704
00:53:31,764 --> 00:53:35,504
- Well, you have to keep in mind...
- Please !

705
00:53:35,548 --> 00:53:38,114
this is a juvenile
we're talking about.

706
00:53:38,157 --> 00:53:41,898
- What ? You're gonna let her free ?
- I didn't say we're gonna let her free.

707
00:53:41,898 --> 00:53:44,813
She can be incarcerated
up to the age of 25.

708
00:53:44,813 --> 00:53:48,161
For that ? Look at him.
Ten years ?

709
00:53:48,161 --> 00:53:52,119
My husband is in there with God knows
how many bullets in his head

710
00:53:52,119 --> 00:53:53,990
and in his back.

711
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:57,643
She deliberately shot him
over and over again.

712
00:53:57,643 --> 00:54:01,166
- I want her held responsible.
- Mrs. Wolverton.

713
00:54:01,166 --> 00:54:04,211
I assure you that whoever did this
isn't just gonna walk away.

714
00:54:04,211 --> 00:54:05,472
What if he dies ?

715
00:54:05,472 --> 00:54:08,561
If he dies, I think that she should
be put in the electric chair.

716
00:54:08,604 --> 00:54:10,127
- Gas.
- What ?

717
00:54:10,257 --> 00:54:12,867
We use gas in California.

718
00:54:12,867 --> 00:54:15,694
I think you know
what I mean, Detective.

719
00:54:15,694 --> 00:54:19,651
I certainly hope that the people
who are prosecuting this case

720
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:23,306
can muster a little more sensitivity
for the rights of the victims...

721
00:54:23,306 --> 00:54:26,524
- than you appear to have.
- I didn't mean to sound uncaring.

722
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:29,742
I want that little monster
to pay for this. For me.

723
00:54:29,742 --> 00:54:33,918
For my husband. For the next person
that she'll end up hurting or killing...

724
00:54:33,918 --> 00:54:36,614
if, God forbid,
she's allowed back on the streets again.

725
00:54:50,924 --> 00:54:53,534
- Vanessa Lutz.
- Yes, sir ?

726
00:54:53,534 --> 00:54:56,970
My name is Garnet Wallace,
and this is my partner Mike Breer.

727
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:59,058
We're with the
L.A. Sheriff's Department.

728
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:02,711
You're that guy on TV,
aren't you ?

729
00:55:05,103 --> 00:55:08,235
Investigating the I-5 murders.

730
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:13,323
Y'all can take a fuckin' cruise, 'cause
I took care of that piece of shit.

731
00:55:13,367 --> 00:55:16,978
Mr. Wolverton's in critical condition,
but he isn't dead.

732
00:55:16,978 --> 00:55:20,414
Oh, yeah, right.
I shot him so many times.

733
00:55:22,414 --> 00:55:26,284
Aren't you concerned about being tried
as an adult for murder ?

734
00:55:26,284 --> 00:55:28,895
Vanessa, the reason that we're here

735
00:55:28,895 --> 00:55:32,636
is to give you an opportunity
to change your story.

736
00:55:33,462 --> 00:55:37,029
That would make me
a big fat liar, wouldn't it ?

737
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,378
Look, kid, cooperate

738
00:55:41,422 --> 00:55:44,119
'cause right now,
we're the best friends you've got.

739
00:55:44,119 --> 00:55:46,381
Yeah, I'm so sure.

740
00:55:46,423 --> 00:55:50,468
- You don't believe we're your friends ?
- I believe you're out to ruin me.

741
00:55:50,468 --> 00:55:52,425
Look, I never said I wouldn't talk.

742
00:55:52,469 --> 00:55:56,427
I might not happen to say
what y'all wanna hear.

743
00:55:56,427 --> 00:56:01,429
You want me to talk, that's fine,
but let me call me fiance right after.

744
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:08,605
Fine. No problem.
Now talk.

745
00:56:08,605 --> 00:56:10,694
What do you wanna know ?

746
00:56:10,694 --> 00:56:14,565
Did Mr. Wolverton say
he was the I-5 Killer ?

747
00:56:14,565 --> 00:56:16,869
He didn't say he wasn't.

748
00:56:17,913 --> 00:56:19,957
- I haven't said I'm the I-5 Killer.
- Yeah.

749
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:22,786
And you haven't said you're gonna
slash me dead with a razor,

750
00:56:22,786 --> 00:56:25,177
and do sex to my dead body neither.

751
00:56:25,177 --> 00:56:27,265
Mr. Wolverton said that to you ?

752
00:56:27,265 --> 00:56:30,310
Yeah, right after
he cut off all my hair.

753
00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:33,137
Then he called me
one of them "garbage people".

754
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:37,487
Then I asked him if he was that killer,
and he started smilin' all proud-like.

755
00:56:37,487 --> 00:56:40,835
You have an opportunity now
to clear your conscience.

756
00:56:41,792 --> 00:56:43,749
I told the truth...

757
00:56:43,749 --> 00:56:46,663
and truth is eternal.

758
00:56:46,663 --> 00:56:48,664
Vanessa Lutz.

759
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:55,623
You still haven't told us why you were
walking around with a loaded gun anyway ?

760
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:58,972
I was gonna sell it
to finance my trip.

761
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:04,105
Yet you ended up shooting some poor slob
who had the decency to give you a ride.

762
00:57:04,105 --> 00:57:07,106
Yeah, except for the decency part.

763
00:57:07,106 --> 00:57:10,977
When did you decide to rob him ?
Was it before or after you shot him ?

764
00:57:10,977 --> 00:57:14,631
Look, that perv owed me for pain and
sufferin', so yeah, I took his money.

765
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:17,328
- Why didn't you turn him in ?
- I wanted to.

766
00:57:17,328 --> 00:57:19,937
But he kept sayin' it would be
his word against mine,

767
00:57:19,937 --> 00:57:24,417
and that he'd get off
and I would go to foster care again.

768
00:57:24,417 --> 00:57:28,070
And aside from that, I knew if I let
him go, he would go kill another girl.

769
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:30,593
And that would've been my fault.

770
00:57:30,593 --> 00:57:34,421
And I couldn't have lived
with that. Never.

771
00:57:34,421 --> 00:57:35,899
No way.

772
00:57:35,899 --> 00:57:39,553
Why were you so convinced
we wouldn't believe you ?

773
00:57:39,553 --> 00:57:42,684
'Cause I've been in the system,
and once you've been in it once,

774
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:45,077
ain't no one never gonna
believe you again.

775
00:57:45,077 --> 00:57:47,251
That's just how it goes.

776
00:57:47,251 --> 00:57:49,558
Tell us about your past
legal problems.

777
00:57:49,558 --> 00:57:51,558
It's all in my file.

778
00:57:51,558 --> 00:57:54,037
I want to hear it from you.

779
00:57:59,562 --> 00:58:03,432
All right. When I was younger, I used
to have this problem with shoplifting.

780
00:58:03,432 --> 00:58:05,911
And I got caught and...

781
00:58:05,955 --> 00:58:08,738
the judge sent me
to this group therapy session

782
00:58:08,738 --> 00:58:10,739
for these girls who are
supposed to be klepto.

783
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:13,349
How many times were you
arrested for shoplifting ?

784
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:16,784
Seven times.

785
00:58:17,916 --> 00:58:20,003
What else ?

786
00:58:22,091 --> 00:58:27,006
Okay. Now this is gonna sound bad,
but it's not as bad as it seems.

787
00:58:28,354 --> 00:58:31,877
But I learned later that
I had this problem with anger.

788
00:58:31,921 --> 00:58:34,617
But I don't have that problem no more.

789
00:58:34,617 --> 00:58:36,792
Just answer the question.

790
00:58:36,792 --> 00:58:42,447
Back in Texas, these cops said
that I lit this shed on fire.

791
00:58:42,447 --> 00:58:45,057
You were arrested for arson ?

792
00:58:45,057 --> 00:58:47,840
Yeah, but nobody got hurt.
It was no big deal.

793
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,753
The judge even said I could
get it "explunged" from my record

794
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:53,364
if I was to go to
these group therapy sessions

795
00:58:53,364 --> 00:58:57,148
with all them teenagers
who are supposed to be firebugs.

796
00:58:57,148 --> 00:58:58,887
But...

797
00:58:58,931 --> 00:59:03,193
that judge got switched,
so that's why it's still there.

798
00:59:03,932 --> 00:59:06,630
How many times were you
arrested for arson ?

799
00:59:08,804 --> 00:59:11,414
Three times.

800
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:13,936
Okay. What else ?

801
00:59:14,241 --> 00:59:17,676
Come on, Vanessa.
Tell us.

802
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:21,027
Soliciting.

803
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:24,462
Just doin' what came natural, huh ?

804
00:59:24,462 --> 00:59:26,115
Hey, Mike.

805
00:59:27,594 --> 00:59:30,595
What's that supposed to mean ?

806
00:59:30,595 --> 00:59:33,423
- Let's get back to the questions.
- No.

807
00:59:33,423 --> 00:59:35,815
What's that supposed to mean ?

808
00:59:35,815 --> 00:59:39,033
You think prostitution comes natural,
like bein' a nigger ?

809
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:40,816
You don't like
bein' called a nigger ?

810
00:59:40,816 --> 00:59:44,252
Well, I don't like being called
a natural-born whore. So there.

811
00:59:44,295 --> 00:59:45,643
- Sit down.
- No !

812
00:59:45,643 --> 00:59:48,036
He's talkin' to me
the way that fuckin' guy did !

813
00:59:48,036 --> 00:59:52,081
Is that why you shot him ? Or because
you wanted what was in his wallet ?

814
00:59:52,081 --> 00:59:55,517
I already told you why I shot him,
you shit-skinned motherfucker.

815
00:59:59,518 --> 01:00:02,085
Fine, you fuckin' coon !

816
01:00:02,129 --> 01:00:05,216
I'll kick your black ass
all over this fuckin' station !

817
01:00:05,216 --> 01:00:07,000
Shithead.

818
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,175
You okay, Mike ?

819
01:00:11,915 --> 01:00:15,569
- Why'd you call him those names ?
- 'Cause he didn't say he was sorry...

820
01:00:15,569 --> 01:00:17,744
and I knew it would piss him off.

821
01:00:17,744 --> 01:00:19,831
Now, how 'bout that phone call ?

822
01:00:19,831 --> 01:00:22,832
Come on, come on.
I need another quarter.

823
01:00:22,876 --> 01:00:24,833
Come on !

824
01:00:28,487 --> 01:00:31,401
Hey, Mrs. Wood.
Is Chopper there ?

825
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:03,630
Holy shit !

826
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:08,023
Look who got beat
with the ugly stick !

827
01:01:08,023 --> 01:01:09,981
Is that you, Bob ?

828
01:01:12,285 --> 01:01:15,721
I can't believe such a little gun could
make such a big mess out of someone.

829
01:01:15,721 --> 01:01:17,287
Are you out of your mind ?

830
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:22,289
You are so ugly, Bob !

831
01:01:22,289 --> 01:01:26,247
You know it's gonna cramp
your style big-time. You know that ?

832
01:01:26,247 --> 01:01:29,596
Especially with little Miss Priss
over there.

833
01:01:29,596 --> 01:01:32,422
And, hey, I heard you have
one of them big poop bags.

834
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:35,947
It's attached to your body
and all your shit lands in it.

835
01:01:35,947 --> 01:01:39,296
You are a big old shit bag,
ain't you, Bob ?

836
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,210
You think of me every time you empty
that fuckin' thing, motherfucker !

837
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:45,124
Quiet ! Stay there.

838
01:01:45,124 --> 01:01:46,820
All right.

839
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:49,909
One more word, young lady,
and you're going to be gagged.

840
01:01:54,823 --> 01:01:57,868
The People versus
Vanessa Julia Lutz.

841
01:01:57,868 --> 01:02:00,260
Your Honor, due to
the heinous nature...

842
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,479
of this crime and the defendant's
obvious lack of remorse,

843
01:02:03,479 --> 01:02:06,306
the State moves
that Vanessa Julia Lutz

844
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,176
be tried as an adult.

845
01:02:08,176 --> 01:02:11,829
Your Honor, my client
is an illiterate child.

846
01:02:13,308 --> 01:02:16,744
- One only has to look at her...
- I've had my look, counselor.

847
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:19,224
And I've been listening too.

848
01:02:19,224 --> 01:02:23,400
I'm going to direct Youth Authority to
prepare a report on the defendant's...

849
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,966
suitability to be tried as an adult.

850
01:03:03,544 --> 01:03:05,632
Hello there, ladies.

851
01:03:06,675 --> 01:03:08,677
Welcome to Bridgewater.

852
01:03:08,677 --> 01:03:12,723
I'm Mrs. Cullins,
and if you follow me,

853
01:03:13,767 --> 01:03:16,594
I'll show you to your beds.

854
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,161
<i>Who am I, am I the type
to leave you where you're standing</i>

855
01:03:23,161 --> 01:03:25,554
<i>Damn right
so watch the way you're acting</i>

856
01:03:25,554 --> 01:03:27,858
<i>Put you under a microscope
and watch you from afar</i>

857
01:03:27,858 --> 01:03:30,164
<i>Rattle up your nerves
in every type of war</i>

858
01:03:30,164 --> 01:03:33,382
<i>Staring out the window 'cause you're
paranoid thinkin' I'm gonna get ya</i>

859
01:03:33,382 --> 01:03:35,687
<i>I got your mind
playin' tricks on you</i>

860
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,949
Venus, this is yours, number eight.

861
01:03:37,993 --> 01:03:39,950
And Vanessa...

862
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:41,907
number 12.

863
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:46,517
Hello, Rhonda.

864
01:03:46,517 --> 01:03:48,692
Hey, Mrs. Cullins.

865
01:03:48,692 --> 01:03:52,564
Say hello to Vanessa.
Vanessa, this is Rhonda.

866
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,217
How you doing ?

867
01:03:56,435 --> 01:03:58,000
I was hoping

868
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,524
that you could show Vanessa
around the craft shop later.

869
01:04:03,219 --> 01:04:05,307
I can't.

870
01:04:05,307 --> 01:04:08,396
See, I'm on...
I'm on restriction.

871
01:04:08,439 --> 01:04:13,223
Rhonda, what did you do
this time ?

872
01:04:13,223 --> 01:04:15,398
Mrs. Joiner said...

873
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:20,923
that I was touching Wanda Z.
all inappropriate.

874
01:04:24,184 --> 01:04:25,923
Rhonda.

875
01:04:25,923 --> 01:04:28,011
I swear !

876
01:04:35,014 --> 01:04:39,408
So, who'd you kill ?

877
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:41,670
What makes you think
I killed somebody ?

878
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:45,236
'Cause they got you wearin'

879
01:04:45,236 --> 01:04:48,150
one of them orange murder suits.

880
01:04:49,107 --> 01:04:52,021
Only the shooters wear
them things.

881
01:04:52,934 --> 01:04:55,326
Actually, I left him for dead...

882
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:58,283
but he pulled through.

883
01:05:00,155 --> 01:05:04,200
I'm here for huffin' paint.

884
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,113
They put you in here for that ?

885
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:09,331
Durin' the strip search...

886
01:05:10,462 --> 01:05:14,030
they found this gram of tar
in my cooch.

887
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:15,595
Do you like tar ?

888
01:05:16,726 --> 01:05:19,726
No. Heroin's way too gnarly for me.

889
01:05:21,205 --> 01:05:22,162
I don't get...

890
01:05:22,248 --> 01:05:24,641
how a person

891
01:05:24,641 --> 01:05:28,905
could go through their whole lives
never being into girls.

892
01:05:31,949 --> 01:05:34,645
I just... I love girls.

893
01:05:35,907 --> 01:05:37,995
You can keep 'em.

894
01:05:37,995 --> 01:05:40,517
You don't know what you're missing.

895
01:05:49,042 --> 01:05:50,738
Chola alert.

896
01:05:54,173 --> 01:05:56,566
- How many ?
- Three.

897
01:05:56,566 --> 01:06:00,220
But you only gotta worry
about one.

898
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:11,878
Oye.

899
01:06:11,878 --> 01:06:13,661
Cockerbunny.

900
01:06:15,226 --> 01:06:17,009
They got you to cheat school

901
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:19,184
or what ?

902
01:06:21,054 --> 01:06:23,056
Bitch.

903
01:06:23,056 --> 01:06:25,665
I'm fuckin' talkin' to you, man.

904
01:06:29,709 --> 01:06:33,145
My name is Vanessa Julia Lutz.

905
01:06:34,102 --> 01:06:35,452
Say it ! Cunt !

906
01:06:45,150 --> 01:06:48,716
415, inmates only, module 1700.

907
01:06:48,716 --> 01:06:51,935
Say my name before
I break your goddamn neck !

908
01:06:51,935 --> 01:06:53,501
Bitch !

909
01:06:57,894 --> 01:06:59,852
Stick it in her.
Stick it in her !

910
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:02,461
Break it up !

911
01:07:02,592 --> 01:07:05,506
Hey ! Let go of me !

912
01:07:05,506 --> 01:07:07,768
Get her to the infirmary !

913
01:07:07,812 --> 01:07:10,378
- Oh, dear.
- Right in there.

914
01:07:12,682 --> 01:07:15,292
This isn't going to hurt
a bit, sweetie.

915
01:07:15,292 --> 01:07:18,207
And afterwards, you can have
a nice little nap.

916
01:07:19,032 --> 01:07:22,164
We can remove those
pesky restraints now.

917
01:07:25,122 --> 01:07:26,775
Get off me !

918
01:07:52,741 --> 01:07:54,698
Hi, honey.

919
01:07:54,698 --> 01:07:57,309
- Grandma ?
- Here I am.

920
01:07:57,309 --> 01:08:00,352
- Hi, honey.
- Grandma ?

921
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,181
Grandma ?

922
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:39,020
<i>Vanessa Julia Lutz.</i>

923
01:08:41,456 --> 01:08:44,761
<i>Inmate shows no remorse
for her crimes.</i>

924
01:08:47,674 --> 01:08:50,415
<i>Inmate is combative.</i>

925
01:08:52,894 --> 01:08:57,069
<i>Refuses to accept responsibility
for her actions.</i>

926
01:08:57,069 --> 01:08:59,157
<i>Recommendations :</i>

927
01:08:59,157 --> 01:09:02,680
<i>This inmate appears to be
a sophisticated criminal...</i>

928
01:09:02,723 --> 01:09:05,638
<i>and an extreme danger
to society,</i>

929
01:09:05,638 --> 01:09:09,161
<i>and should be required to pay
the penalty for her actions...</i>

930
01:09:09,161 --> 01:09:12,293
<i>in a facility for adult criminals.</i>

931
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,338
<i>Diagnosis :</i>

932
01:09:15,338 --> 01:09:18,121
<i>antisocial personality disorder.</i>

933
01:09:19,514 --> 01:09:21,253
<i>Prognosis :</i>

934
01:09:21,253 --> 01:09:23,341
<i>very poor.</i>

935
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:26,386
<i>Recommendations :</i>

936
01:09:29,299 --> 01:09:31,778
<i>Oh, this individual is probably
too far gone</i>

937
01:09:31,821 --> 01:09:34,605
to benefit from corrective
behavior modification

938
01:09:34,605 --> 01:09:39,303
of the kind offered
in a setting for juveniles.

939
01:10:08,618 --> 01:10:12,358
Hello, Vanessa.
Do you think you can join

940
01:10:12,358 --> 01:10:14,882
the rest of us now ?

941
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:18,405
If nobody gives me
no more problems.

942
01:10:21,536 --> 01:10:25,277
<i>We need to put an end to the system
that lets dangerous, violent thugs...</i>

943
01:10:25,319 --> 01:10:29,583
<i>be prosecuted as juveniles,
rather than as adults,</i>

944
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:32,584
<i>even when they have committed
the most vicious crimes.</i>

945
01:10:32,584 --> 01:10:35,715
<i>Hi, this is Janice Miller
of Inside View.</i>

946
01:10:35,715 --> 01:10:39,890
<i>We're here with Mr. Robert Wolverton
and his wife Mimi Wolverton...</i>

947
01:10:39,890 --> 01:10:42,284
<i>at their home in Orange County.</i>

948
01:10:42,284 --> 01:10:45,546
<i>Would you describe some
of the hardships</i>

949
01:10:45,546 --> 01:10:48,982
<i>you've had to endure
since this ordeal began ?</i>

950
01:10:48,982 --> 01:10:51,678
<i>My husband's been
permanently disfigured.</i>

951
01:10:51,678 --> 01:10:54,070
<i>How can he work
with children again ?</i>

952
01:10:54,070 --> 01:10:58,029
<i>His appearance...
Well, it frightens them.</i>

953
01:10:58,029 --> 01:11:01,290
<i>He's unable to have
sexual relations.</i>

954
01:11:01,290 --> 01:11:04,900
<i>You're saying your husband
is no longer capable...</i>

955
01:11:04,944 --> 01:11:06,292
<i>of achieving an erection ?</i>

956
01:11:06,292 --> 01:11:08,250
<i>That part of our lives is over now.</i>

957
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:10,338
<i>What makes me so angry</i>

958
01:11:10,338 --> 01:11:14,209
<i>is how that little monster ridiculed us
during her preliminary hearing.</i>

959
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:15,557
<i>And the media.</i>

960
01:11:15,557 --> 01:11:18,470
<i>How dare the media talk about
how horrible her life is.</i>

961
01:11:18,470 --> 01:11:19,949
<i>What about us ?</i>

962
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:23,995
<i>Psychopath. She's been locked up,
nine, ten times ?</i>

963
01:11:23,995 --> 01:11:27,040
<i>Why was she ever let back out
on the streets again ?</i>

964
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:30,693
<i>If the teenager who allegedly
shot your husband were here,</i>

965
01:11:30,693 --> 01:11:32,564
<i>what would you say to her ?</i>

966
01:11:32,564 --> 01:11:35,261
<i>Was it worth the $ 300
she stole from him ?</i>

967
01:11:35,261 --> 01:11:37,783
<i>Are you bitter...</i>

968
01:11:37,783 --> 01:11:39,740
<i>Mr. Wolverton ?</i>

969
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,871
<i>Well, Janice...</i>

970
01:11:42,871 --> 01:11:45,916
<i>after all the wonderful letters</i>

971
01:11:45,916 --> 01:11:51,136
<i>that we received
from across the country...</i>

972
01:11:51,136 --> 01:11:54,962
My neck may not function,
but I have not lost my smile.

973
01:11:54,962 --> 01:11:59,137
<i>No, I'm not a bitter man.</i>

974
01:11:59,137 --> 01:12:02,488
<i>I know there's a lot of people
looking for some real-life heroes.</i>

975
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:04,271
<i>I think I found a few.</i>

976
01:12:04,271 --> 01:12:08,098
<i>Their courage is a real inspiration.</i>

977
01:12:08,141 --> 01:12:10,620
<i>Stay tuned for an unusual story</i>

978
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,970
<i>about a couple of sweltering
polar bears in Texas.</i>

979
01:12:41,719 --> 01:12:43,677
Holy shit.

980
01:12:44,721 --> 01:12:46,895
It's okay.

981
01:12:54,115 --> 01:12:58,466
Want me to go get you
some party punch ?

982
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,685
No, I ain't thirsty.

983
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:11,732
You're all wigged out, huh ?

984
01:13:12,776 --> 01:13:16,733
I get all these bad nightmares
once I get out of isolation.

985
01:13:18,081 --> 01:13:19,038
God...

986
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:24,258
I am so happy to get out.

987
01:13:24,258 --> 01:13:26,346
I mean, I can't...

988
01:13:26,346 --> 01:13:29,129
I can't even sleep at all...

989
01:13:29,173 --> 01:13:32,043
let alone have nightmares.

990
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:37,088
For me, it's like I get
all shrunk down.

991
01:13:38,437 --> 01:13:41,046
I don't get what you mean.

992
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:46,788
It's like I get like a cat
or a dog or somethin'.

993
01:13:48,005 --> 01:13:51,269
You can tell I'm just like
they all are.

994
01:13:52,834 --> 01:13:56,139
If I get in the hole much longer,
I'm gonna be like this hermit...

995
01:13:56,183 --> 01:13:59,271
shunning all human contact.

996
01:13:59,271 --> 01:14:01,358
Scared-like.

997
01:14:03,576 --> 01:14:07,622
It's like that song says,
Vanessa.

998
01:14:08,448 --> 01:14:10,667
People need people.

999
01:14:15,146 --> 01:14:18,278
I ain't so sure about that,
Rhonda.

1000
01:14:21,279 --> 01:14:24,714
What is it that you think
that you need ?

1001
01:14:27,846 --> 01:14:31,196
I'll tell you.
Back in the hole, I decided

1002
01:14:31,196 --> 01:14:34,198
all I need to live was my will...

1003
01:14:39,938 --> 01:14:42,026
and a knife's good too,

1004
01:14:42,026 --> 01:14:45,375
so you don't feel
so at the mercy of events.

1005
01:14:48,812 --> 01:14:52,464
- Wow. You made this ?
- Yeah.

1006
01:14:52,464 --> 01:14:55,161
My stepfather Larry showed me how.

1007
01:14:55,205 --> 01:14:57,162
It's pretty cool, huh ?

1008
01:15:01,250 --> 01:15:04,034
What are you gonna do with it ?

1009
01:15:04,034 --> 01:15:06,122
Get the hell outta here.

1010
01:15:07,296 --> 01:15:10,079
You might have to mess up
some of the staff.

1011
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:13,516
You really feel sorry
for them people ?

1012
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:17,301
Think normal people wake up one day and
decide they're going to work in prison ?

1013
01:15:17,301 --> 01:15:18,649
They're perverts...

1014
01:15:18,736 --> 01:15:20,823
every last one of them.

1015
01:15:21,693 --> 01:15:25,216
Any of them fuckos get in my way,
I'm gonna make them wish they hadn't.

1016
01:15:32,524 --> 01:15:35,220
Do you like that ?

1017
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:40,222
I'll make out with you...

1018
01:15:40,222 --> 01:15:41,701
but no fucking.

1019
01:15:41,701 --> 01:15:42,919
I'm straight.

1020
01:15:50,051 --> 01:15:52,008
Okay, you two.

1021
01:15:52,747 --> 01:15:55,880
Your Honor, it's obvious
my client is an unstable child.

1022
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,576
It says here : "Nearly illiterate,
emotionally immature,

1023
01:15:58,576 --> 01:16:00,883
prone to impulsivity,
unpredictable..."

1024
01:16:00,883 --> 01:16:03,275
Your Honor, she is charged
with a gruesome crime.

1025
01:16:03,275 --> 01:16:04,622
Counselor, please.

1026
01:16:04,753 --> 01:16:06,709
It goes on to say
she should be tried as an adult.

1027
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:09,016
She will be tried as an adult.

1028
01:16:09,016 --> 01:16:10,669
Thank you, Your Honor.

1029
01:16:10,669 --> 01:16:15,061
Jury selection will commence
on June 8 at 10:00 a.m.

1030
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:18,496
Are we leaving ?

1031
01:16:20,063 --> 01:16:23,195
What are y'all lookin' at ?
Fuck all y'all.

1032
01:16:23,195 --> 01:16:27,588
Fuck you, chipmunk face,
and your fuckin' skipper wife.

1033
01:16:31,850 --> 01:16:36,547
I see here that you and Vanessa were
arrested together twice in two years.

1034
01:16:36,547 --> 01:16:38,200
Yeah.

1035
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:41,027
We needed money. We thought
it would be grown-up turning tricks

1036
01:16:41,027 --> 01:16:43,506
on Warren Avenue
outside the Snack-N-Shop.

1037
01:16:43,549 --> 01:16:47,290
Except we got pinched
in five minutes. Bitch.

1038
01:16:47,290 --> 01:16:50,510
You two were engaged in acts
of prostitution in the sixth grade ?

1039
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:53,423
We were only gonna
jack 'em off is all.

1040
01:16:53,423 --> 01:16:56,990
Did you ever see Vanessa

1041
01:16:57,077 --> 01:17:00,513
act in an overtly hostile way
to an actual human being ?

1042
01:17:02,427 --> 01:17:05,210
You mean like blow somebody's
brains out all over the place ?

1043
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,820
- You think that's funny ?
- Yeah.

1044
01:17:09,299 --> 01:17:11,778
What about her boyfriend
who passed away ?

1045
01:17:13,995 --> 01:17:16,172
It was pretty exclusive.

1046
01:17:18,694 --> 01:17:21,390
Okay, Cherry, that'll be all for now.
Thank you.

1047
01:17:38,093 --> 01:17:40,876
I know she's blowing it
over him.

1048
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:51,837
Well, what do you know ?

1049
01:17:57,492 --> 01:18:00,579
- She's a coal-burner.
- What's a coal-burner ?

1050
01:18:00,579 --> 01:18:03,493
It means her boyfriend's black.

1051
01:18:03,536 --> 01:18:05,407
Are you surprised ?

1052
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:07,364
- Aren't you ?
- You know, Mike...

1053
01:18:07,364 --> 01:18:10,496
every kid we've spoken to
about this Lutz girl...

1054
01:18:10,496 --> 01:18:13,105
seems to hold her
in very high regard.

1055
01:18:13,105 --> 01:18:17,499
Look at her friends. They're
the most fucked-up kids I've ever seen.

1056
01:18:17,499 --> 01:18:20,195
- Still, something just doesn't...
- What ?

1057
01:18:21,675 --> 01:18:24,893
- I gotta go back to the crime scene.
- It's two-and-a-half hours away.

1058
01:18:24,893 --> 01:18:25,851
Wallace !

1059
01:18:26,894 --> 01:18:29,286
Go. Get it out of your system.

1060
01:19:10,345 --> 01:19:12,128
Go on.

1061
01:19:13,389 --> 01:19:17,781
Diamonds on the back, ladies.
Diamonds on the back.

1062
01:19:18,914 --> 01:19:22,132
I'm going to get some jerky.
Stay in line !

1063
01:19:33,832 --> 01:19:37,138
Don't forget to wash
your hands now, ladies.

1064
01:19:40,486 --> 01:19:43,226
Do you think that
little guard's cute ?

1065
01:19:43,226 --> 01:19:46,533
I guess.
Yeah, sort of punky.

1066
01:19:48,751 --> 01:19:52,057
Better watch out 'cause it's gonna
get crazy in here in a second.

1067
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:54,884
You gonna cut up that cute guard ?

1068
01:19:54,884 --> 01:19:59,495
- If he gets in my way, I will.
- Well, you're stupid...

1069
01:20:00,843 --> 01:20:04,061
if you think you can
get past both them.

1070
01:20:04,061 --> 01:20:06,975
What the fuck do you care
what happens to me ?

1071
01:20:06,975 --> 01:20:12,499
I'm here on double murder, okay ?
In two years, I'm gonna be 18.

1072
01:20:12,499 --> 01:20:16,282
I'm going to be sent to Frontera for
20 years, so why shouldn't I help ?

1073
01:20:17,631 --> 01:20:19,065
Because two heads

1074
01:20:20,109 --> 01:20:23,024
are a lot fuckin' better
than one head.

1075
01:20:27,548 --> 01:20:30,113
Hurry up in there, ladies.

1076
01:20:33,377 --> 01:20:35,769
<i>- Come on, now.
- All right.</i>

1077
01:20:42,033 --> 01:20:45,467
- Don't you fuckin' breathe !
- Vanessa.

1078
01:20:45,467 --> 01:20:48,382
- I'm dead serious. What did I say ?
- Where did the hack go ?

1079
01:20:48,382 --> 01:20:50,991
He-he went to get...

1080
01:20:50,991 --> 01:20:53,818
a beef treat, Mesquita.

1081
01:20:53,818 --> 01:20:55,776
- And he'll be right back.
- Shut up.

1082
01:20:55,776 --> 01:20:58,516
- You can't get by the both of us.
- Shut up !

1083
01:20:58,516 --> 01:21:01,212
- Think about it...
- Shut up !

1084
01:21:17,697 --> 01:21:20,612
- My sister Brenda thinks you're cute.
- I do not.

1085
01:21:20,612 --> 01:21:23,830
- You do too.
- Where's Mrs. Cullins ?

1086
01:21:24,700 --> 01:21:26,136
I don't know.

1087
01:21:30,006 --> 01:21:32,485
Who told you you could fight ?

1088
01:21:33,659 --> 01:21:36,139
- You didn't have to kill me.
- What ?

1089
01:21:36,139 --> 01:21:40,227
- You didn't have to kill me !
- I didn't, you dirty little pervert.

1090
01:21:40,227 --> 01:21:43,967
Gimme your goddamn car keys
before I cut your pecker off.

1091
01:21:43,967 --> 01:21:47,099
That won't feel very good,
will it ?

1092
01:21:47,099 --> 01:21:49,492
- He sure is bloody.
- I still think he's cute.

1093
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:55,537
Move the fuckin' leg, man !

1094
01:21:57,016 --> 01:22:00,017
- Move your fuckin' face !
- Mesquita, I'd really like to go now.

1095
01:22:15,589 --> 01:22:17,981
Good night, everybody !

1096
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:28,071
My homeys are here, Vanessa.

1097
01:22:34,465 --> 01:22:36,726
I missed you so much.

1098
01:22:36,726 --> 01:22:39,118
You smell the same.

1099
01:22:41,728 --> 01:22:45,600
- What happened ?
- I was playing with ketchup.

1100
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,950
This is...
my little bunkie Vanessa.

1101
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:53,733
<i>Quiere un carro. Okay ?</i>

1102
01:22:53,733 --> 01:22:57,083
<i>And don't you worry, Cacahuete.
Everything will be all right.</i>

1103
01:22:57,083 --> 01:22:58,822
All right.

1104
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,130
- You look pretty.
- Thanks.

1105
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:13,045
So... you won't think
I sound all feminist and shit.

1106
01:23:13,045 --> 01:23:15,089
It's like...

1107
01:23:15,133 --> 01:23:19,612
the one thing that I learned
in jail is that...

1108
01:23:20,743 --> 01:23:23,658
girls gotta help out
other girls, you know ?

1109
01:23:24,832 --> 01:23:27,833
Especially convict girls 'cause...

1110
01:23:27,833 --> 01:23:31,486
if they don't,
they oughta be fucking dead.

1111
01:23:31,486 --> 01:23:34,706
- Know what I mean ?
- I hear what you're sayin'.

1112
01:23:41,621 --> 01:23:43,666
Need me to drop that off
anywhere ?

1113
01:23:43,709 --> 01:23:46,709
No. The owner, he won't mind.

1114
01:23:50,581 --> 01:23:52,321
Badass.

1115
01:23:55,365 --> 01:23:57,540
You're going to need this, girl.

1116
01:23:57,540 --> 01:23:59,758
Oh, Mesquita, you already done
too much for me.

1117
01:23:59,758 --> 01:24:05,065
This ain't even $20. This bomb's
a total gas hog. Don't be stupid.

1118
01:24:05,065 --> 01:24:07,675
You know what I really need
is a gun.

1119
01:24:16,546 --> 01:24:18,504
<i>You gonna give her my juguete.</i>

1120
01:24:18,504 --> 01:24:20,811
<i>I'll get you another one, pendejo.</i>

1121
01:24:20,811 --> 01:24:23,942
I'll get you a cellular too
and a beeper.

1122
01:24:23,942 --> 01:24:26,030
I'll get ahold of your ass.

1123
01:24:26,030 --> 01:24:28,117
Watch out for the pigs, Vanessa.

1124
01:24:28,117 --> 01:24:31,030
Yeah, I'm sorry
for busting your nose that time.

1125
01:24:31,030 --> 01:24:33,119
I was just real upset that day.

1126
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:36,555
Oh, that hurt.
I'm all trying to work it...

1127
01:24:36,555 --> 01:24:39,469
so I can get you to put out
with me later on.

1128
01:24:39,469 --> 01:24:42,513
I guess I went about it
pretty dumb, huh ?

1129
01:24:42,513 --> 01:24:45,819
Mesquita, I'd put out for you
any day of the week.

1130
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:49,603
I only do that in lockup.

1131
01:24:49,908 --> 01:24:51,560
Come here.

1132
01:25:02,739 --> 01:25:05,653
Good morning, Mrs. Wolverton.

1133
01:25:06,697 --> 01:25:09,915
- Have you found her ?
- No, we haven't.

1134
01:25:09,915 --> 01:25:13,352
- I don't think you're in any danger.
- Oh, really.

1135
01:25:13,395 --> 01:25:16,918
Well, your life hasn't been ruined
by this little monster, has it ?

1136
01:25:16,918 --> 01:25:19,310
Is your husband here now ?

1137
01:25:19,310 --> 01:25:21,832
No. He's at St. John's
doing his physical therapy.

1138
01:25:21,832 --> 01:25:24,224
Now what the hell
are you doing here ?

1139
01:25:24,224 --> 01:25:27,226
Go over to the hospital and escort
Mr. Wolverton back here, please.

1140
01:25:27,226 --> 01:25:29,097
Why ?

1141
01:25:31,227 --> 01:25:34,446
Mrs. Wolverton,
I have a search warrant here.

1142
01:25:34,446 --> 01:25:37,664
- What ?
- If you would just sign anywhere.

1143
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:40,275
I'm not signing anything.

1144
01:25:41,927 --> 01:25:46,015
Steve, make note that Mrs. Wolverton
refused to sign the search warrant.

1145
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:48,407
- I don't believe this.
- So noted.

1146
01:25:48,407 --> 01:25:50,713
Take care of downstairs.

1147
01:25:50,713 --> 01:25:55,411
And make sure you check out
the garage, backyard, everything.

1148
01:25:55,411 --> 01:25:57,803
What's this all about ?

1149
01:25:57,803 --> 01:26:00,587
Mrs. Wolverton, certain evidence
has come to light,

1150
01:26:00,630 --> 01:26:02,587
which we are duty bound
to investigate.

1151
01:26:02,587 --> 01:26:05,936
- What sort of evidence ?
- I would prefer to discuss it...

1152
01:26:05,936 --> 01:26:09,243
in the presence of your husband,
if you don't mind.

1153
01:26:10,112 --> 01:26:11,852
There's a...

1154
01:26:11,895 --> 01:26:15,201
There's a storage shed out back.
I'm going to take a look.

1155
01:26:15,722 --> 01:26:18,332
You wouldn't happen
to have the key, would you ?

1156
01:26:18,332 --> 01:26:21,464
- Fuck you.
- Didn't think so.

1157
01:26:39,515 --> 01:26:42,646
Robert Wolverton. Correct.

1158
01:26:42,646 --> 01:26:44,299
Age 32.

1159
01:26:45,473 --> 01:26:47,953
Yeah, forensics is on its way.

1160
01:26:47,953 --> 01:26:52,214
Tony found some remains.
Human, animal... Who knows ?

1161
01:26:52,214 --> 01:26:53,911
Mrs. Wolverton...

1162
01:26:53,911 --> 01:26:57,130
were you aware
your husband had mental problems ?

1163
01:26:57,130 --> 01:26:58,608
Those...

1164
01:26:59,957 --> 01:27:01,914
Those were...

1165
01:27:01,914 --> 01:27:03,915
Those were child...

1166
01:27:03,915 --> 01:27:05,698
Children ?

1167
01:27:05,698 --> 01:27:07,133
Yes.

1168
01:27:07,785 --> 01:27:11,612
Just like the Lutz girl we've been dying
to see get strapped in the gas chamber.

1169
01:27:16,093 --> 01:27:18,485
- Will you ease up on her ?
- Fuck her !

1170
01:27:38,014 --> 01:27:39,580
Jesus.

1171
01:28:05,242 --> 01:28:06,895
<i>Por favor.</i>

1172
01:28:07,721 --> 01:28:09,375
<i>Gracias.</i>

1173
01:28:11,158 --> 01:28:15,246
<i>Hey, ladies !
Donde estan los chicos?</i>

1174
01:28:21,814 --> 01:28:23,467
<i>Sexo!</i>

1175
01:28:23,467 --> 01:28:25,555
<i>Sexo!</i>

1176
01:28:25,555 --> 01:28:27,729
<i>Yeah, muy bueno.</i>

1177
01:28:30,251 --> 01:28:32,774
Want to score, baby ?
Come on.

1178
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,951
Fuck you too.

1179
01:28:42,561 --> 01:28:45,170
Hey, babe.
Ooh, me so horny.

1180
01:28:46,431 --> 01:28:48,605
Yeah, what about now ?

1181
01:28:49,649 --> 01:28:51,739
Fuck you too.

1182
01:28:52,566 --> 01:28:54,044
Back again, huh ?

1183
01:28:54,044 --> 01:28:55,609
Want to fuck ?

1184
01:28:55,609 --> 01:28:57,175
How much ?

1185
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:04,960
Depends on what you're into.

1186
01:29:05,092 --> 01:29:06,961
Do you suck cock ?

1187
01:29:10,093 --> 01:29:12,571
Sure. I can do that.

1188
01:29:14,051 --> 01:29:16,051
I just wanna get sucked.

1189
01:29:16,051 --> 01:29:19,792
All right. Find us an alley and I'll
take care of you where you're sitting.

1190
01:29:19,792 --> 01:29:21,966
I'll pay $25.

1191
01:29:21,966 --> 01:29:25,316
I can live with that. Let's go.

1192
01:29:33,449 --> 01:29:36,145
- You're underage, aren't you ?
- Is that a problem ?

1193
01:29:36,145 --> 01:29:37,712
No.

1194
01:29:37,712 --> 01:29:39,930
Young people gotta live too.

1195
01:29:39,930 --> 01:29:43,148
Sure got that right.
Now get 'em all down, okay ?

1196
01:29:43,148 --> 01:29:45,759
Makes it a whole lot easier that way.

1197
01:29:53,979 --> 01:29:56,892
And gimme all your money !
All of it !

1198
01:29:56,936 --> 01:29:58,372
Goddamn it !

1199
01:29:59,634 --> 01:30:03,156
Jesus ! Okay !
Hey, I'm sorry, okay ?

1200
01:30:03,156 --> 01:30:06,810
- I was aimin' at your head, mister !
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1201
01:30:06,810 --> 01:30:09,853
If you get this over quick,
we'll both be a lot happier.

1202
01:30:09,853 --> 01:30:12,855
My money's in my briefcase
in the backseat.

1203
01:30:12,855 --> 01:30:14,117
Don't move it !

1204
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:17,857
Just lean over and open it up
where it's laying.

1205
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:20,380
And keep your pants where
they are, Mr. Dirty Mouth !

1206
01:30:24,556 --> 01:30:28,297
Don't swing that motherfuckin' thing
at me, or I swear to God you're dead !

1207
01:30:28,297 --> 01:30:29,558
Believe me ?

1208
01:30:29,558 --> 01:30:31,645
Why are you doing this ?

1209
01:30:31,645 --> 01:30:35,603
Because I'm pissed off and the whole
world owes me. Now gimme your money !

1210
01:30:45,607 --> 01:30:46,868
Where's the rest of it ?

1211
01:30:46,956 --> 01:30:49,043
That's all I got.

1212
01:30:49,043 --> 01:30:51,870
You was just gonna give me
five dollars !

1213
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:55,219
Please, please.
Just take it, okay ? Please ?

1214
01:30:55,219 --> 01:30:58,743
Get out of the goddamn car
right now, you little pecker snot !

1215
01:30:58,743 --> 01:31:00,003
Right now !

1216
01:31:01,177 --> 01:31:02,613
No !

1217
01:31:02,613 --> 01:31:06,267
Get all them panties off
before I get really pissed !

1218
01:31:08,443 --> 01:31:10,531
You think I'm kiddin' ?

1219
01:31:12,226 --> 01:31:14,792
Now get your ass in the trunk.

1220
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:17,749
Please...

1221
01:31:19,011 --> 01:31:20,142
I'm claustrophobic.

1222
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:24,101
Well, I get claustrophobic
suckin' strange dick. Get in there !

1223
01:31:24,101 --> 01:31:26,057
Please, I gotta pee.

1224
01:31:26,101 --> 01:31:29,841
Well, pee in there, motherfucker !
I ain't kiddin' !

1225
01:31:29,841 --> 01:31:31,494
Now !

1226
01:31:31,494 --> 01:31:33,146
Dumbass.

1227
01:31:36,713 --> 01:31:40,236
I'm sorry, sir.
This is a no-smoking restaurant.

1228
01:31:54,546 --> 01:31:58,069
You really are a dear, Flo.

1229
01:32:01,767 --> 01:32:04,638
Would you care for a warm-up ?

1230
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:08,116
No, thank you.
I'd like to order.

1231
01:32:08,943 --> 01:32:11,552
What would you like ?

1232
01:32:11,552 --> 01:32:13,639
Some chicken soup,

1233
01:32:13,639 --> 01:32:16,337
with a fucking straw.

1234
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:50,133
<i>Let me out !
I'm dying in here !</i>

1235
01:32:50,133 --> 01:32:52,437
Oh, you are ?
Well, do it now.

1236
01:32:53,481 --> 01:32:56,701
Will you slow down, for Christ's sake ?
You're gonna get us killed.

1237
01:32:58,484 --> 01:33:00,441
There... There's the exit.

1238
01:33:11,531 --> 01:33:13,272
Grandma !

1239
01:33:14,837 --> 01:33:16,185
Grandma !

1240
01:33:17,577 --> 01:33:19,099
Grandma !

1241
01:33:23,927 --> 01:33:25,146
Grandma !

1242
01:34:19,602 --> 01:34:22,950
<i>Let me out.
I'm dying in here.</i>

1243
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:29,517
Grandma, it's me !

1244
01:34:29,517 --> 01:34:32,128
It's me, Vanessa !

1245
01:34:32,128 --> 01:34:34,085
Hey, Grandma.

1246
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,085
It's me, Vanessa.

1247
01:34:37,564 --> 01:34:39,521
Hi, Grandma.

1248
01:34:40,130 --> 01:34:42,435
Grandma, wake up.

1249
01:34:42,435 --> 01:34:44,089
It's time to wake up.

1250
01:34:44,132 --> 01:34:48,699
I'm your granddaughter. I'm here
to take care of you forever and ever.

1251
01:34:48,699 --> 01:34:50,568
Why are you hiding ?

1252
01:34:51,917 --> 01:34:54,222
Here, let me see.

1253
01:34:57,660 --> 01:35:00,791
Them's some big ugly
fuckin' teeth you got, Bob.

1254
01:35:04,139 --> 01:35:06,531
How do you like that,
Vanessa ?

1255
01:35:06,531 --> 01:35:08,619
You like how that fucking feels ?

1256
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:12,143
- What did you do with my grandma ?
- Do you want to see your grandma ?

1257
01:35:14,448 --> 01:35:16,623
What do you think of grandma, kid ?

1258
01:35:16,666 --> 01:35:18,927
You fucker !

1259
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:22,798
- You killed my grandma !
- That's not all I did to grandma.

1260
01:35:25,626 --> 01:35:26,757
Naomi.

1261
01:35:26,757 --> 01:35:29,584
Naomi, listen. I brought you
an extension cord...

1262
01:35:35,324 --> 01:35:38,631
Die, you piece of dick ! Dead !

1263
01:35:41,981 --> 01:35:43,981
Die, you fucker !

1264
01:35:48,678 --> 01:35:49,722
Back inside !

1265
01:35:49,722 --> 01:35:51,375
My God !

1266
01:35:56,072 --> 01:35:58,551
Die, you piece of shit !

1267
01:35:58,551 --> 01:36:00,247
Goddamn pig !

1268
01:36:01,161 --> 01:36:03,248
Let's go !

1269
01:36:11,077 --> 01:36:13,600
Fuckin' perv !

1270
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,644
Piece of shit !

1271
01:36:26,214 --> 01:36:27,867
Die !

1272
01:36:41,307 --> 01:36:43,307
Come on.

1273
01:36:44,568 --> 01:36:46,439
Oh, shit.

1274
01:36:46,439 --> 01:36:49,788
Get out of there.
Get out of there !

1275
01:37:09,491 --> 01:37:11,361
Holy shit.

1276
01:37:14,277 --> 01:37:16,146
Holy shit.

1277
01:37:19,496 --> 01:37:20,539
Holy shit.

1278
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:36,153
Y'all got a cigarette ?

1279
01:37:39,153 --> 01:37:43,153
