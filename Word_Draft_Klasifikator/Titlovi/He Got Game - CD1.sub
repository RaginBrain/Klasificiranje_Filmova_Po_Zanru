{7786}{7877}- What's up, bro?|- Game's over. Warden wants to see you.
{7879}{7941}The warden?|What's this all about?
{7943}{8005}Don't know nothin'.|Don't wanna know nothin'.
{8007}{8076}He tells me to get you,|so I get you.

{8609}{8682}Jake, please sit down.|Sit down.
{8749}{8828}I was told you were|on the court.
{8830}{8894}Yes, sir.|I try to stay fit, trim.
{8896}{8977}You know, everything like that.|Keep my mind occupied.
{8979}{9071}As you already know, you've picked|the perfect recreation.
{9072}{9133}Dr. James Naismith|knew what he was doin'.
{9135}{9224}- It's a great game, isn't it?|- Basketball, yes.
{9225}{9302}- You played some?|- Uh, yes, sir, when I was younger.
{9303}{9364}- You know, I put in a little work.|- I coach my son's team.
{9366}{9414}I ran a neighborhood center.
{9416}{9475}Let's go. Show me that.|Oh, good!
{9476}{9551}That's good, but you crossed over.|You still bailed out.
{9553}{9613}- You coached?|- Nah, nothing like that there.
{9615}{9698}You know, I see somebody out there,|a little kid who needs some help.
{9699}{9755}I work with him,|give him a few tips.
{9756}{9791}- Which hand did you shoot with?|- Right.
{9793}{9822}- Which hand are you|supposed to be shooting with?|- Left.
{9824}{9883}But nowadays, uh,|Warden, they--
{9885}{9955}these kids ain't gonna listen|to nothin' you say, you know.
{9957}{10003}They think they know it all.
{10005}{10063}All they wanna do is dunk and--|you know, everything like that.
{10064}{10137}Their fundamentals is, uh--|is, like, sorely lacking.
{10139}{10191}That's strange.|I haven't had that problem yet.
{10193}{10242}Y eah, well, you--
{10244}{10294}The kids are smart.
{10296}{10377}They know they don't listen to you,|they end up in here with me.
{10378}{10455}I never thought about it like that.
{10457}{10523}Did you vote for Governor Pernell?
{10525}{10571}Uh, nah, I ain't never voted.
{10573}{10656}No matter. What does matter|is Governor is a big,
{10658}{10732}huge, fanatical|basketball fan.
{10734}{10813}He played himself--|four years, varsity, at Big State.
{10815}{10888}Good, not great athlete.
{10889}{10979}He's the biggest supporter|Big State has. Bleeds red and white.
{10981}{11060}Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think I saw|something like that about him on TV.
{11062}{11145}Do you have a son named|Jesus Shuttlesworth?
{11147}{11173}Y es, sir.
{11174}{11249}Is your son considered the number one|high school prospect...
{11251}{11317}in these United States|of America?
{11318}{11380}Some people rate him|that high, some don't.
{11382}{11464}- You know, two, three, six.|- Come on, Jake. Come on.
{11466}{11539}Don't be modest. You oughta be proud.|You oughta be proud as a peacock.
{11541}{11622}I always been proud of my son even|before he was the number one prospect...
{11624}{11676}in the whole entire world.
{11678}{11756}- You aren't modest, after all.|- God is working with me on that, sir.
{11758}{11861}The governor's made a request|that your son, Jesus Shuttlesworth,
{11863}{11953}seriously consider enrolling|in his alma mater, Big State.
{11955}{12014}If you persuade your son|to do this,
{12016}{12071}the governor's given me|his word...
{12073}{12135}he'll do everything|in his power to...
{12137}{12202}cut your time here short,|considerably.
{12203}{12250}The governor can do that?|He can--
{12252}{12334}- He can do that.|- I'm lookin' at 15, Warden. I mean--
{12336}{12382}This is for real, right?
{12384}{12463}You can make the governor|very happy.
{12465}{12574}He's got a great reputation|for never forgetting anyone|who's done right by him.
{12576}{12649}He's also never forgiven anyone|who's done him wrong.
{12651}{12724}Can't do nothin' in here, though.|I mean, behind these--
{12726}{12806}Behind these bars, you know,|these walls and everything like that,
{12808}{12901}I mean, something|like this here...
{12902}{12957}can't be worked out|over the phone or--
{12958}{13017}We have to get started right away.
{13019}{13122}The NC two-A deadline for kids|to declare is one week away.
{13123}{13159}- One week?|- Seven days.
{13161}{13193}- Everything's been arranged.
{13195}{13258}- It's all been worked out.|- The Bulls ain't got nothin',
{13260}{13299}especially against|the Knicks.
{13301}{13382}- All you ever talk about is|Jordan this, Jordan that.
{13444}{13496}Guard!
{13498}{13584}-You do your part, you deliver your son,
{13586}{13628}- Guard!|- Governor Pernell will do his part.
{13630}{13700}- Guard!|- What the hell's goin' on in there?
{13701}{13758}You'll have to excuse|the temporary discomfort,
{13759}{13816}but we can't trust|in your abilities as an actor.
{13818}{13870}There's little margin|for error.
{13872}{13924}Let's go, Doc!|Hurry up.
{13926}{13980}Where you takin' him?
{14014}{14071}- What's wrong with this inmate?|- I don't know.
{14072}{14118}- Food poisoning?|- Are you sure?
{14120}{14175}I don't know.|He just rolled him in.
{14177}{14247}I want this inmate|quarantined immediately.
{14249}{14328}- Looks like he ate some|of this fine prison cuisine.|- I can't take a chance.
{14329}{14400}Last time something like this happened,|half the prison population got sick.
{14401}{14473}- He's quarantined now. He's contagious.|- God!
{14474}{14525}One last thing.
{14526}{14578}Don't try any funny business.
{14580}{14629}- Any shenanigans, the deal is off.
{14629}{14644}- Any shenanigans, the deal is off.
{14646}{14702}Can't you make him shut up?
{14703}{14757}- The guy's in pain.|- Then give him something.
{14758}{14840}We got two more hours to go.|Man, I don't wanna hear that shit.
{14842}{14894}Two parole officers|will be assigned to you.
{14896}{14959}- Spivey, he's a black man.
{14961}{15010}You should like him.|He should like you.
{15012}{15066}Your other chaperone is Crudup.
{15068}{15139}Quiet. But, as my father told me,|it's the quiet one's you have to watch.
{15140}{15192}Spivey, I'm sick|as a dog, man.
{15193}{15280}Here. Drink that.
{15282}{15335}Drink it.
{15370}{15420}Spivey and Crudup,
{15422}{15475}two of the best,|handpicked by me.
{15477}{15581}If necessary, these men have|been given a green light to shoot.
{15583}{15681}We don't give a shit about you,|or you being sick as a dog.
{15683}{15756}You wanna throw up, let us know.|We'll pull over.

{16088}{16163}Yeah, capisce.|Can you pull over?
{16165}{16214}Please?

{19730}{19822}Yeah! We're the Lincoln Railsplitters,|baby! What, what, what, what?
{19824}{19885}You didn't read the paper|that day, son?
{19887}{19971}Aw! Railsplitters!|That's right.
{19973}{20041}So Jesus|has led the Railsplitters...
{20043}{20106}to the Promised Land despite|being down late the second half.
{20107}{20177}Coach Cincotta's team|refused to die.
{20179}{20265}They come back to win it,|and there's bedlam at the Garden.
{20267}{20317}Number one.
{20385}{20448}The game brings me|love, peace and happiness.
{20505}{20560}My name is Sip Rodgers.
{20561}{20615}I go to Abraham Lincoln High School.
{20617}{20663}I play the two-spot.
{20665}{20732}We're the Railsplitters,|and nobody's fuckin' with us.
{20782}{20852}Basketball is like|poetry in motion.
{20854}{20924}Just comin' down the court,|you got a defender in your way.
{20926}{20996}You take him to the left.|You take him back to the right.
{20998}{21077}And he's fallin' back,|and you just "J" right in his face.
{21079}{21142}And then you look at him,|and then you say, "What?"
{21194}{21252}Basketball's the birthplace|of all of my dreams,
{21254}{21342}of everything that I wanna be, of|everything I wanna accomplish in life.
{21405}{21482}I feel handsome when I'm on the court.|I feel like I'm somebody.
{21884}{21934}The way this goes down|is simple
{21936}{22001}From this day forth|anything dealing with rap stay off
{22003}{22068}This the play-offs|No payoffs, strictly skills
{22070}{22127}If your brain's insane|then stick to your deals
{22129}{22199}In this field it ain't about sellin'|a mil wit' the run of the mill
{22201}{22293}So just be tellin' it real, it ain't|like a third-time felon's appeal
{22294}{22353}Till a god schools 'em|and tells 'em the deal
{22355}{22411}I'll allow you to write|maybe allow you to bite
{22412}{22473}If you down to fight the power|here's the power to fight
{22475}{22543}I overpower the mic|Hit the crowd wit' da bomb diggy
{22544}{22593}Ring the alarm|Now the squad's wit' me
{22595}{22650}From way back I shown no weakness|when I speak this
{22652}{22714}Mentally strong to keep this hit|and my speech is given
{22715}{22771}Now listen from the beginnin'|till I reach the endin'
{22773}{22826}My short story's winnin'|and keep the beat spinnin'
{22828}{22906}You know the name, P.E.|You know the game, P.E.
{22908}{22980}We ain't for the fame|We for the change

{23297}{23344}We back harder than ever|Follow my lead
{23345}{23381}Through the fast lane|in the game
{23383}{23449}This is Mr. Shuttlesworth.|His key?
{23451}{23532}You ain't ready to get it, I don't|know why they keep askin' for it
{23534}{23589}Is this guy gonna mean|any trouble?
{23591}{23662}Nah, he's not|gonna mean any trouble.
{23663}{23735}If you somewhat sure|Hip-hop's like a chess game
{23737}{23815}Discussing the war, strategize|Move like masterminds
{23816}{23898}- So where y'all stayin' at?|- Marriott, mid-town Manhattan.
{23900}{23965}That's what I figured. Why aren't|I stayin' down there with y'all?
{23967}{24029}Only place|on Coney lsland, my man.
{24031}{24107}Why waste all that valuable time|commuting back and forth...
{24109}{24171}when you can walk|to see your son right from here?
{24173}{24230}You also don't have a choice.
{24232}{24312}The way I see it, this is better|than your room at the hoosegow.
{24313}{24380}- This is the Ritz to you.|- I ain't mad at nobody.
{24383}{24443}You understand|what I'm sayin'?
{24476}{24554}Yeah. Yeah, this is|better than the Marriott.
{24583}{24662}Keep your hands still.|There you go.
{24664}{24723}- All right. Sit down.|- Huh?
{24724}{24809}You heard what the fuck I said.|I said sit down!
{24811}{24908}There's a couple of things|I think we better go over.
{24910}{24964}Number one:|You ain't on vacation.
{24966}{25013}You're not a free man.
{25015}{25098}In the eyes of the law,|you are still a convicted felon.
{25100}{25177}Your ass is ours.|You understand that?
{25207}{25265}- Do you?|- Yeah, I over-stand it.
{25267}{25337}- Then answer us when we speak to you.|- I understand it, over-stand it.
{25339}{25398}The sooner you do|what you gonna do,
{25399}{25483}the better it will be|for all concerned parties.
{25485}{25555}Mr. Shuttlesworth,|you are now wired.
{25613}{25735}It's a letter of intent|for your son to sign. Take it.
{25736}{25799}In here there's some money.|Get some clothing.
{25801}{25901}Toothpaste, deodorant,|personal effects, whatever have you.
{25903}{25976}Take a shower. Wash your ass.
{26021}{26068}Give me your right leg.
{26070}{26185}Just in case you get any smart ideas,|we will track you down.
{26187}{26251}And when we find you,|we will shoot you dead.
{26253}{26300}- You have to check in with us daily.
{26301}{26382}Plus, when we page you, you have to|return our call within ten minutes...
{26383}{26435}or there's gonna be|hell to pay.
{26437}{26510}Yeah. So y'all gonna be|following me everywhere I go?
{26512}{26573}No, we're not gonna|follow you.
{26575}{26674}We're gonna get you a passport,|plane ticket and a VlSA card.
{26676}{26758}Of course we're gonna be around.|What the fuck you think we're gonna do?

{28857}{28904}In the middle|of the universe
{28905}{28977}Then why is this verse|coming six times rehearsed

{33208}{33290}They care about themselves.
{33291}{33365}They're just tryin' to get over, tryin'|to get a piece of Jesus, that's all.

{40822}{40876}Can Daddy's little Boo Boo|keep a secret?
{40878}{40927}Yeah.
{40929}{41049}I'm out on a-- what you call like a...|work release program, baby,
{41051}{41100}where's if l--
{41102}{41178}- Well, I got a week to do a job.|- Meaning?
{41180}{41261}Meaning if I do a good job,|I can get out sooner than expected.
{41263}{41355}- What kind of job do you have to do?|- I can't tell you that yet.
{41356}{41449}Because I'm too young.|I cannot wait until I'm 18.
{41451}{41519}I am tired of people telling me|that I'm not old enough.
{41521}{41577}"Can't do this. No, no, honey,|can't do this. You're too young--"
{41578}{41636}Hold on, hold on.|Sit down.
{41680}{41784}Look. Number one, you ain't too young.|You're a young woman.
{41785}{41848}It's just that I could...|get in trouble.
{41850}{41929}- Now, you don't want your daddy|to get in trouble, do you?|- No.
{41931}{42024}I don't want you getting into any more|trouble. I know it wasn't your fault.
{42026}{42089}I know you didn't mean it.
{42131}{42219}You don't know what|that means to your daddy.
{42221}{42283}Now, let's hit them Skittles.
{42285}{42356}Your brother, he's doin'|all right, huh?
{42358}{42404}- He is so good.|- Yeah?
{42406}{42462}He is better than good, Daddy.|You should see him play.
{42464}{42514}He's a zillion times better|than when you last saw him.
{42516}{42593}- Remember when he used to be|so weak on his left hand?|- Yeah.
{42595}{42651}Naw, now he can handle it|with both.
{42653}{42710}- And he can shake so good.|- Can he?
{42712}{42765}I bet he can finally beat you.
{42793}{42824}You think so?
{42898}{42962}- Yeah, he probably can.
{43023}{43108}You've reached Mary and Jesus.|We're not at home.
{43110}{43183}- Leave a message at the beep.
{43185}{43237}It's me, baby. It's Lala.
{43378}{43449}- Hello, son.
{43450}{43509}Mary, what did I tell you|about letting strangers in the house?
{43511}{43594}- He's not a stranger. He's our father.|- I don't have a father.
{43595}{43634}- Hey, wait a minute--|- Daddy, he's trippin'.
{43636}{43708}Trippin'? We'll see who's trippin'|later on tonight.
{43710}{43790}- What did I tell you about|talking to strangers anyway?|- "Don't do it."
{43791}{43852}- And why?|- Because it may cause us harm.
{43854}{43922}So why did you let|this stranger in our house?
{43924}{43958}Mary, do you hear me talking to you?|Don't play deaf.
{43958}{43964}Mary, do you hear me talking to you?|Don't play deaf.
{43966}{44037}I'm not standing here for|my health, and you ain't deaf.
{44038}{44116}- Don't talk to your sister like that.|- Am I talkin' to you?
{44118}{44223}Matter of fact, I don't|even know why you're here.
{44225}{44274}Mary, answer me right now.
{44275}{44329}I won't do it again,|I promise!
{44331}{44398}It's time for you|to get to steppin'.
{44399}{44485}And I'd appreciate it if you don't|ever walk through that door ever again.
{44487}{44553}All right.|Look, I need to talk to you.
{44554}{44638}- Why?|- I just need to. When can we talk?
{44640}{44696}I don't know.|I'm usually around.
{44698}{44772}- Where you gonna be at?|'Cause this is kinda urgent.|- I'm usually at the Garden.
{44774}{44820}- All right.|- All right.
{44822}{44908}- I'll see you down there.|- Yeah, you can see me there.
{45029}{45093}Enjoy the Skittles, baby.
{45095}{45162}Now you enjoy walkin'|out that front door.
{45227}{45281}- Where you think you're goin'?|- Help!
{45282}{45333}Get in there!
{45411}{45464}Open the door!
{45466}{45537}- Who's tryin' to break the door down?|- Booger!
{45587}{45657}What's up?
{45658}{45734}Hey, how y'all doin'?
{45736}{45816}- Not good.|- What's wrong, dear?
{45817}{45879}- Guess who showed at the apartment?|- Who?
{45881}{45939}- Daddy.|- Lord have mercy!
{45941}{46008}- Booger, take your cousin in your room.|- Go in the room.
{46010}{46060}Come on, Mary. Um--
{46062}{46119}You can play with|my Sony Playstation.
{46120}{46196}- Good, 'cause I can always beat you.|- I'm gettin' good at--
{46198}{46250}Sit down, son.
{46280}{46338}When did all this happen?
{46387}{46477}- About half an hour ago.|- What did he say? What does he want?
{46478}{46531}He says he wants to speak to me.|He says it's urgent.
{46533}{46625}- It don't make no sense.|- It makes perfect sense.|He smells the money.
{46627}{46732}What I'd like to know, how does a|convicted murderer get out so quick?
{46734}{46820}How can this happen?|He's not even eligible for parole yet.
{46822}{46879}He told Mary that he was out|on a work release program or something.
{46881}{46945}The man escaped|just like Shawshank.
{46946}{47020}Clint Eastwood in Escape From Alcatraz.|The Fugitive.
{47022}{47096}- He wasn't acting like no fugitive.|- We should call the cops.
{47098}{47177}- Yeah.|- We ain't gonna do no such a thing.
{47178}{47229}I think you need to go|and talk to your father.
{47231}{47277}He ain't my father,|all right?
{47279}{47373}I know how you feel, son,|but the fact remains he is your daddy.
{47375}{47463}But as your legal guardians as appointed|by the court in the state of New York,
{47465}{47529}I feel you need to involve us|more in your life.
{47531}{47581}Jesus, we're family.
{47583}{47635}Your mother-- Martha,
{47669}{47757}my sister-- I loved her.
{47759}{47824}We feel responsible|for the both of you.
{47825}{47916}I made a promise to your mother|that if anything ever happened to her,
{47918}{48005}that we would be there|for the both of you.
{48007}{48069}You hear me, Jesus?
{48071}{48159}Like I said, son, you need to talk|to your daddy, see what he has to say.
{48161}{48223}I told him I'd be here|at the Garden.
{48224}{48330}Before you go now, I want you to use|some of my John the Conqueror root.
{48331}{48397}This is what my daddy brought|up here from Mississippi.
{48399}{48494}Now, you rub some of this here between|your wrist and your elbow, see,
{48496}{48543}just like this here.
{48544}{48615}- Now, this'll fix you up real good.|- Oh, Bubba.
{48616}{48695}Don't nobody care nothin'|about your country, backward old root.
{48697}{48771}-This mojo works! It worked on your ass!|-Hmph!
{48773}{48847}- No, thanks, Uncle Bubba.|- Suit yourself.
{48849}{48944}- You make a decision yet?|- No, not yet.
{48946}{49040}Your Aunt Sally feels bad|that we aren't being included|in such an important decision.
{49040}{49140}He does not speak for me!|You do what you feel is right.
{49142}{49236}- Thank you, Aunt Sally.|- Will you be quiet, please?
{49237}{49303}What they offerin' you, boy?|What they gon' give you?
{49305}{49392}- Full athletic scholarship.|- Whoo! That's wonderful!
{49394}{49450}Full athletic scholarship,|that's all?
{49452}{49519}No money, no cars,|no job for your family?
{49521}{49593}- No school say nothin' like that.|- See, I don't believe that.
{49595}{49644}You're tryin'|to hold out on us.
{49646}{49696}- Holdin' out?|- You're tryin' to cut us out the deal.
{49698}{49786}- What deal?|- The deal is about to go down!|I hear things.
{49787}{49835}No, you ain't hear that.
{49837}{49894}Think of your Uncle Bubba,|your Aunt Sally.
{49896}{49966}I think it's only right that we|be compensated for sacrifices...
{49968}{50016}we made when we|took y'all in.
{50018}{50114}Bubba! I don't want|any part of this.
{50214}{50274}I'm goin' into the bedroom.
{50276}{50360}Good. Take your big ass|on in the bedroom, then.
{50362}{50432}Why you gotta talk to Aunt Sally|like that? I thought we were family.
{50434}{50515}-We are family. Blood, thick as thieves.|-I don't even know why l--
{50554}{50599}My controls ain't workin'.|It's stickin' or something.
{50601}{50666}I'm the bomb. I'm the bomb.|Say it. I'm the bomb.
{50668}{50761}Mm-hmm, yo, I'm the bomb.|You know I'm the bomb, right?
{50762}{50831}Now, we put out|a lot of money for y'all.
{50833}{50904}All I'm asking is that you|let me wet my beak a little bit.
{50906}{50947}- Wet your beak?|- Wet my beak, son.
{50949}{51047}You didn't see The Godfather ll?|The man was called The Black Hand.
{51049}{51106}- I suspect you already|got a deal in place.|- What kind of deal?
{51108}{51162}The kind of deal that would enable you|to get your own apartment,
{51164}{51229}pay rent, pay Ma Bell,
{51230}{51326}pay Con Ed, buy clothes, furniture|with no visible means of income.
{51328}{51407}You ain't got no job, son!|No J-O-B!
{51409}{51510}- Don't try to play me for no fool now.
{51512}{51585}- Am I making this clear?|- Yeah, you're making it very clear!
{51586}{51662}When I really get paid, I ain't gonna|lose track of you and Aunt Sally!
{51664}{51752}I'm gonna take care of you,|with interest if you want!
{51754}{51826}I ain't too old to have dreams.|Is that what you think?
{51827}{51918}I still got dreams.|I got plans too. Big plans.
{51920}{52015}- Now, why should me and|your Aunt Sally get cut off?|- Anything else, Uncle Bubba?
{52080}{52126}- Yo.|- Yeah!
{52128}{52206}- Check 'em.|- Ahh!
{52208}{52254}- These are the new Jordans.
{52256}{52344}That's it, huh? Y eah.|How much these cost, man?
{52346}{52452}- 139, 150 with tax.|- One-fi'ty? Where the holes at?
{52454}{52495}They're on the inside.|You gotta lace 'em up that way.
{52497}{52556}- Do that for me, man, all right?|- Y eah, no problem, man.
{52557}{52606}Let's get rid of this first.
{52608}{52658}139!
{52751}{52798}It's arthritis.
{52800}{52872}You know, I got that, uh...|arthritis thing happening.
{52874}{52942}Y eah? My brother's got|the same arthritic condition.
{52944}{52986}- Really?|- Only it's his left ankle.

{55609}{55685}- Naw.|- Son, l--
{55778}{55860}- If your mother could see--
{55861}{55936}Hey, all right. I'm sorry, all right?|Hey, wait a minute.
{55937}{55986}That's the wrong way to start|a conversation with me.
{55988}{56034}All right. Hold up, hold up.
{56036}{56097}Look, you get|any of them letters?
{56138}{56198}Y eah, I got|your stupid letters.
{56200}{56269}I tore 'em up too.
{56270}{56333}- What about Mary's?|- I tore those up too.
{56335}{56461}All right. Since you too scared|to play me, can we talk for a moment?
{56463}{56520}- Talk about what?|- A lot of things.
{56522}{56610}I gotta ask you a few questions,|you know, catch up on things.
{56612}{56682}Look, I don't have a lot of time,|so make it quick.
{56684}{56754}I got even less time,|so I'm gonna make it real quick.
{56756}{56854}I read all about you,|everything like that, and, uh--
{56856}{56935}Game really developed.|All the hard work done paid off.
{56936}{56999}I'm proud of you, son.|I mean that.
{57001}{57076}I know these are|tough times for you now.
{57078}{57155}So I figure, hey, you know,|you might need some fatherly advice.
{57157}{57192}- From who?|- From me.
{57193}{57286}- About what?|- About, number one,|where you gonna go to school.
{57287}{57346}- Have you made a decision?|- Aw, damn! You too?
{57348}{57398}I already know|what you're about to say.
{57400}{57454}"This is about to be the most|important decision in your life."
{57456}{57505}That ain't what I was about to say.|I'm gonna ask you--
{57507}{57557}I'm just hopin' that you|ain't compromisin' yourself, son.
{57559}{57634}I know what's going on. I know people|are offering you all kinds of things.
{57636}{57752}I just don't wanna see you beholden|to somebody for something you done took.
{57753}{57806}- Something I took?|- Yeah.
{57808}{57890}What do you expect? I gotta|take care of Mary, nobody else but me.
{57891}{57949}I refuse to let Mary grow up|in the same apartment with Uncle Bubba.
{57951}{58069}Look. All I'm sayin' is--|I would like to know where you're goin'.
{58070}{58143}- What difference does it|make where I'm goin'?|- I would like to know.
{58145}{58220}I don't know yet.|I have to weigh my options.
{58222}{58302}- You got any idea?|- Like I told the rest of|the world, I don't know yet.
{58330}{58407}I pray that you understand...
{58409}{58468}why I pushed you so hard.
{58470}{58529}It was only to get you|to that next level, son.
{58531}{58595}You's the first Shuttlesworth that's|even gonna make it out these projects.
{58597}{58686}I was the one who put the ball in|your hand. I put the ball in your crib.
{58687}{58738}- I ain't no baby no more.|- All right.
{58739}{58826}Why the hell did you name me Jesus|anyway? What type of name is that?
{58827}{58900}- It's a biblical name.|- No kiddin'.
{58902}{58962}- You don't like that name?|- I never liked my name.
{58964}{59035}- You ain't never told me.|- I used to tell Mommy a lot of things.
{59037}{59115}- Why you ain't never tell me?|- You haven't been around lately.
{59116}{59210}I used to hate for Mom|to call me in to come in for dinner.
{59212}{59271}Jesus! Jesus!
{59272}{59342}You're lucky my dribble's got--
{59344}{59413}- Dusted in for the N.B.A.|- Shut up! You look like--
{59415}{59473}- You look like a cockroach.|- Cockroach?
{59474}{59531}Cockroach this then.|Cockroach this.
{59533}{59609}That way. That way.
{59655}{59728}You just can't shoot|the darn fool.
{59730}{59799}- Ooh, shoot it? Shoot it?|- Yeah, shoot it.
{59801}{59892}- Jesus!
{59893}{59950}- Jesus! Jesus!|- Jesus!
{59951}{60044}Jesus, time to come in and eat.|Bring your cousin Booger with you.
{60046}{60100}Could I just finish|one more shot, please?
{60102}{60181}- No! I said now, and I mean it!|- Come on.
{60182}{60264}People used to think she was|some type of religious freak,|catchin' the Holy Ghost.
{60265}{60314}Save me, Jesus!|Save me, Jesus!
{60316}{60386}- Just stop, Booger! That ain't funny!|- Well, it's funny to me.
{60388}{60473}Funny to me, just like you pickin'|and eatin' your boogers all the time.
{60475}{60541}- I don't eat my boogers!|- Yes, you do!
{60543}{60602}Man, you never seen me|eat my boogers.
{60604}{60663}How many you see me eat?|One, two or three?
{60665}{60735}I came to this court by myself.|Why you gotta follow me?
{60737}{60819}- Maybe I wanted to play with Jesus.|- Jesus!
{60821}{60869}Jesus! Jesus!
{60871}{60927}- Jesus!|- Look at that.
{60929}{60995}Moses parted the Red Sea,|not Jesus.
{60997}{61048}- Moses, Jesus, whatever.|- Whatever?
{61050}{61084}Whatever.
{61086}{61164}Everybody and their mama's running|around sayin' they're born again.
{61166}{61249}Especially all|these athletes and entertainers.
{61251}{61345}They get caught smokin' crack|in the hotel with ten whores.
{61347}{61449}All of a sudden they have a religious|experience? They find Jesus, all right.
{61450}{61536}What's wrong with finding Jesus, huh?|What's wrong with that?
{61538}{61643}How come you never hear Jesus being|praised in the losers' locker room then?
{61644}{61710}- They're probably cursin'|that motherfucker out.|- Hey, wait, wait, wait.
{61712}{61759}- First, number one--|- God ain't shit.
{61760}{61829}Number one, why you gotta use|all this kinda language?
{61831}{61889}You some kind of heathen now?|You don't make no mistakes?
{61890}{61961}You be out here shootin', but you|don't miss no shots ever? Ever?
{61962}{62049}People make mistakes. People veer off|the path. So what? God forgives them.
{62050}{62109}- Has God forgiven you|for killing my mother?|- I pray that He has.
{62111}{62209}- I believe He has. When will you?|- Never.
{62211}{62257}All right.|Well, hey, look.
{62295}{62361}- Hey. Shit.|- "Thou shall not kill."
{62362}{62424}- lsn't that from the Good Book?|- That's in the Good Book. So?
{62425}{62513}So what? Ain't nothin' I can do, son,|that can bring your mother back.
{62515}{62595}What you want me to do, huh?
{62597}{62645}Did you even love my mother?
{62647}{62708}Y es, I loved her!
{62709}{62778}I loved her more than life itself.
{62780}{62854}You sure did have|a hell of a way of showin' it.
{62886}{62967}When you goin' back anyway?
{62969}{63044}Yo, I got next.|I got next game, bro.
{63332}{63404}I wanna go eat.
{63406}{63475}Jesus, you off|the phone yet?
{63505}{63557}Hey.
{63589}{63643}You been on the phone|all night.
{63645}{63715}All these schools callin', we need|to just get another unlisted number.
{63717}{63801}- It still gets out.|- I'll be so glad when|all this stuff is over.
{63802}{63862}- I know you will.|- How long's it gonna be?
{63864}{63968}- Monday morning.|- Praise the Lord, and thank you, Jesus.
{63970}{64033}You think that's funny, don't you?
{64035}{64088}- I like teasing you.|- I know you do.
{64089}{64161}Everybody says I'm gonna be rich,|won't have to worry about a thing.
{64163}{64267}- Did your father tell you that?|- No, but everybody else in the world.
{64268}{64332}Everybody else|in the world don't know.
{64334}{64408}Everybody says you're gonna play pro|ball and have your own Nike sneakers...
{64410}{64473}and star in commercials|and make mad loot.
{64475}{64536}So much money that we won't be|in Coney lsland no more.
{64538}{64585}What did I tell you about listening|to what people say?
{64586}{64676}I hear what you say, but if|everybody's sayin' the same|thing, it's gotta be true.
{64678}{64781}Uncle Bubba even said you were|gonna buy him and Aunt Sally|some new house in Long lsland.
{64783}{64845}He asked me if I want|to go house shopping with him.
{64847}{64925}Looking for a big old house, too,|with, like, a green lawn and grass...
{64927}{64995}and lots of trees|and even a swimming pool in the back.
{64996}{65048}- Uncle Bubba told you that?|- Mm-hmm.
{65050}{65092}- I'm gonna have to talk|to that uncle of yours.|- All the kids in school say,
{65092}{65128}- I'm gonna have to talk|to that uncle of yours.|- All the kids in school say,
{65130}{65200}since I'm gonna be|so rich and famous, that...
{65202}{65262}I'm not gonna need to go|to school anymore...
{65264}{65313}'cause I already know how to count|and I'm just wasting my time.
{65315}{65381}If I hear you talkin' like that again,|I'll kill you myself!
{65382}{65416}Dang! Let go of me!
{65418}{65477}All those kids don't mean shit!|I'm raising you, nobody else!
{65479}{65525}- Get off of me!|- We're not rich.
{65527}{65573}We don't have no money.|We don't have shit.
{65575}{65664}If those were really|your friends, they wouldn't be|filling your head with bullshit.
{65666}{65761}I didn't say I believed it. I just said|that that's what people are saying.
{65763}{65820}- Can't believe you listen|to that bullshit.|- Fine! I'm sorry, all right?
{65822}{65878}Goodness!
{65926}{65997}You never tell me nothin'.|You never even have time for me no more.
{65999}{66067}Well, it's gonna be over|Monday morning, okay?
{66309}{66368}I'm really trippin'.
{66498}{66574}I'm sorry. I apologize|for putting my hands on you, okay?
{66607}{66638}I'm just-- I'm afraid.
{66678}{66724}Me too.
{66726}{66798}I mean, I just want|the best for both of us.
{66800}{66885}And, you know, Mommy,|she wanted you to go to college.
{66886}{66948}All these people around here, half|these people aren't going to college.
{66950}{67010}Mommy wants you|to get your degree.
{67012}{67094}Why is Daddy here?|Why did he come back?
{67095}{67144}He's not gonna be here|much longer.
{67146}{67206}But, Jesus,|I miss him so, so much.
{67293}{67374}- Go to sleep.|- Good night.
{67502}{67582}Hello, everyone. I'm Robin Roberts.|Welcome to Sports Center.
{67584}{67648}Tonight, our feature is|about a biblical player--
{67649}{67716}the Chosen One, the second coming,|the resurrection,
{67718}{67765}the salvation.
{67766}{67844}ESPN gets religion as we follow a day|in the life of Abraham Lincoln senior...
{67846}{67956}Jesus Shuttlesworth, the number one|basketball prospect in the country.
{67958}{68014}Jesus of Coney lsland.
{68015}{68098}Jesus is the best thing to happen to the|game since the tennis shoe was invented.
{68100}{68149}Jim Faen from Mount|Saint Mary's used to say,
{68151}{68217}"He gives me a tingle,"|and I think that's what Jesus does.
{68218}{68270}He makes you excited|to watch him.
{68271}{68322}Whew! Jesus Shuttlesworth.
{68324}{68394}He's the next phenom!|He's awesome, baby, with a capital "A"!
{68396}{68470}The guy's unbelievable!|He's a P.T.P., a prime time player!
{68472}{68548}He's the 3-S man!|Super, scintillating, sensational!
{68550}{68589}He's a high riser!
{68590}{68639}His game has got|everything you need.
{68641}{68708}He can defend.|He can run. He can finish.
{68709}{68772}He likes to play in a crowd,|and he can pass the basketball.
{68774}{68825}He makes people better.|He's the real thing.
{68827}{68902}He's able to do some of the things|that most coaches talk about,
{68903}{68971}and that is being able|to be a triple threat.
{68973}{69073}If that's something that we|as coaches have used for many|years-- dribble, pass and shoot.
{69075}{69179}Pure shooter, fearsome defender,|a great player.
{69181}{69249}He was coming down for a fast break,|and the defender went for the ball.
{69250}{69337}He brought it behind his back|and switched it over to his right hand.
{69339}{69376}It went through his legs.
{69378}{69447}Defender came up and kind of|stutter-stepped a little bit,
{69448}{69528}pulled back and rang the three.
{69530}{69576}This kid might be ready|for the big leagues.
{69578}{69651}He plays to win, and a lot|of people play to play.
{69653}{69709}This guy plays to win.
{69711}{69777}He understands that if he|performs better, they are going to win.
{69779}{69847}But he knows how to pass.|He plays with his teammates.
{69849}{69927}He has all the attributes|that go into being a winner.
{69929}{69977}When I watched|Kenny Anderson's stuff,
{69979}{70062}- I'd never thought I would see|anybody better than those guys.|- Shit.
{70063}{70112}But along came Jesus.
{70113}{70202}There are very few players|that give you 40 minutes of everything.
{70203}{70297}Michael Jordan'll give you 35.|But 40 minutes of everything he's got...
{70299}{70343}because of what he's overcome|in his life.
{70345}{70402}In terms of dealing|with his sister,
{70403}{70519}and all of the pitfalls that come|with being in a deprived situation.
{70521}{70627}And in a situation that's void of any|kind of leadership other than his own,
{70629}{70697}he's had to be|very, very self-reliant.
{70699}{70793}Now, with kids as good as he is, he's|probably receiving a lot of pressure...
{70794}{70867}to go into the N.B.A.|because so many kids are doing it.
{70869}{70951}When you see a kid with this kind|of talent, it's almost normal for him...
{70953}{71029}to take that into consideration with the|kind of money that they're getting now.
{71031}{71103}But I would tell him that he needs to go|to college and get an education...
{71105}{71164}so that he'll be able to save|the money that he has.
{71165}{71240}My mother, she always|told me that, that...
{71242}{71351}it was great to be a superstar athlete|and to be able to make it to the N.B.A.
{71353}{71466}But... I mean, you're nothing|without your education.
{71468}{71545}And, you know, ever since day one,|she wouldn't let me play basketball.
{71546}{71645}She wouldn't let me play in the garden,|from day one, unless I did my homework.
{71647}{71693}That's right.
{71695}{71775}I think when April 11th comes,|I just wanna let my hair down,
{71777}{71823}kick my feet up|and have a good time.
{71825}{71881}Just go hang out with my boys|back in high school:
{71883}{71922}- Sip, Booger, Lonnie, Mance.|- Lincoln! Linc-- Linc-- Lincoln!
{71923}{71975}- Man, those are my partners.|- My name is Sip!
{71976}{72023}- Yeah!|- Whether east or west!
{72024}{72067}- Yeah!|- I rock this joint!
{72068}{72130}- Yeah!|- With the most finesse. Roll call!
{72132}{72202}Lincoln! Linc-- Linc-- Linc--|Lincoln! Roll call!
{72204}{72246}- My name is Jesus.|- Yeah!
{72248}{72289}- I am the man.|- Yeah!
{72291}{72325}- What's up with these questions...|- Yeah!
{72327}{72355}about my plan?
{72357}{72435}I think it would just be|a sin that...
{72437}{72515}you know, come...|two months from now,
{72516}{72581}when I graduate,
{72583}{72645}my mother, she won't be able|to attend my graduation...
{72647}{72702}because, of course, she passed.
{72703}{72783}What most impresses me|about Jesus Shuttlesworth...
{72785}{72839}is the foresight|of his parents...
{72841}{72936}to name him appropriately|as the world's greatest.
{72938}{72982}- Jesus.|- Jesus.|- Jesus.
{72983}{73043}- Jesus.|- Jesus.|- Oh, Jesus!
{73045}{73087}- Jesus.|- Jesus.|- Jesus.
{73089}{73134}- Jesus.|- Jesus.|- Jesus.
{73136}{73191}- Jesus.|- Hallelujah, Jesus! Hallelujah!
{73192}{73228}He got game.
{73231}{73311}Who brought you this Victoria's Secret|bra-and-panties shit?
{73313}{73384}Bitch, where do you get|this shit from? You crazy?
{73386}{73456}-Bitch, are you outta your fuckin' mind?
{73457}{73504}- Dakota.|- I'm sorry.
{73505}{73553}Damn!
{73554}{73617}- I'm sorry, baby.
{73619}{73685}The director is God.
{73687}{73776}You have no vision from nobody.
{73777}{73831}You tryin'|to antebellum my ass.
{73833}{73912}You tryin' to fuckin'|plantationalize on me, ain't ya?
{73914}{73991}- Bitch, this ain't Gone With The Wind.
{73993}{74078}You ain't Scarlett O'Hara!|I ain't Rhett Butler!
{74080}{74130}- Bitch, I'll kick your ass.
{74132}{74187}Take that goddamn shit off.
{74189}{74237}- Fuckin' with me.
{74239}{74295}Who the fuck|you think you are?
{74296}{74376}I'm sorry.
{74474}{74526}Bitch must be crazy.
{74527}{74592}Chillin' me with some goddamn shit|from some other motherfucker.
{74594}{74661}Who the fuck|does she think she is?
{74663}{74756}I can't believe that bitch|did me like this.
{75075}{75154}Hello?
{75155}{75205}You all right? I heard|a lot of noise next door.
{75207}{75269}I thought maybe you need some help,|or something like that.
{75409}{75457}Here, let me help you up.
{75459}{75505}- What the hell do you want?|- It's all right. Come here.
{75506}{75554}I won't hurt you.|Come here.
{75556}{75641}- You can walk? You all right?
{75643}{75749}Yeah. I need... some help!
{75751}{75836}You weren't knocking on that door|while I was getting my ass beat.
{75838}{75897}- Yeah, well, I didn't want to get|all up in your business--|- Smart, huh?
{75899}{75994}- My God, it's funny, isn't it?|- Y'all got some ice around here?
{75995}{76113}Oh, the sink doesn't work. There's|some cold water in the bathroom tub.
{76206}{76252}Oh, God.
{76416}{76471}At least I still got my teeth.
{76615}{76674}- Put this right here.|- Thanks.
{76676}{76722}Yeah. Right there.
{76854}{76920}I seen you around, you know.
{76922}{76975}- I noticed you right away.|- Y eah?
{76977}{77050}- You don't belong here.|- Oh, yeah? How can you tell that?
{77052}{77131}You don't seem like|the type of guy that would be here...
{77132}{77189}in this house of ill repute.
{77329}{77376}My name's Dakota.
{77413}{77463}You ever been there?
{77465}{77522}- Where?|- Dakota.
{77524}{77614}Oh, no, no, no.|I ain't never been nowhere.
{77616}{77689}- I'm from upstate New York.
{77691}{77752}- I'm, uh, Jake. Jake--|- Please, no last names.
{77754}{77833}In my line of work,|last names aren't needed.
{77835}{77940}You're actually better off|without them.
{77942}{78022}- Why he beat you like that?|- Because he can.
{78024}{78070}And why you let him though?
{78072}{78125}Look. Are you trying to get|inside my head or something?
{78126}{78178}- You trying to see how I think?|- Naw.
{78179}{78229}You think you're|real slick, huh?
{78266}{78349}Naw, I just, you know--

{79392}{79482}And, you know, I deserved it.|It keeps me in line.

{79541}{79605}You know,|we're going to get married...
{79607}{79671}once he saves up enough money|to get out of this...
{79673}{79719}sh-shit-hole.
{79721}{79780}Here, let me freshen|that up for you.
{79824}{79871}So what about you?
{79872}{79920}- I mean, look.
{79920}{79978}That's one of my problems,|or one of my many problems.

{81383}{81465}- Okay?|- I ain't talking about|nothing like that.
