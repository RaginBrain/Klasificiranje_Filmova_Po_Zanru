2
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:42,923
Shelley?

3
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:44,973
Dance with me?

4
00:00:45,186 --> 00:00:48,104
In your dreams, loser!

5
00:00:59,367 --> 00:01:00,530
Lily?

6
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:03,321
Will you dance with me?

7
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:15,372
Paige?

8
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,586
Will you dance with me?

9
00:01:18,804 --> 00:01:21,211
I'd rather be boiled alive.

10
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:30,179
Hi, Kate.

11
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,597
Want to dance?

12
00:01:31,817 --> 00:01:33,145
Maybe later, Jeremy.

13
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,269
Okay. Maybe later.

14
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:46,115
Hi, Dorothy.

15
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:49,994
Do you want to dance with me?

16
00:02:15,027 --> 00:02:18,230
Check it out. Thick and thin getting it on.

17
00:02:18,322 --> 00:02:21,442
-you like it, Buffalo? Getting hot?
-Stop. Get away from me!

18
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,651
Did Pervert attack you?

19
00:02:23,869 --> 00:02:24,865
yeah.

20
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,071
Jeremy attacked me. He attacked me!

21
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,867
Pervert jumped Buffalo.

22
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,324
-I didn't know!
-Pervert.

23
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:21,006
It's simple, really, Shelley.

24
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:24,634
you see, from an evolutionary
point of view...

25
00:03:24,847 --> 00:03:29,094
...Jason looks for an attractive young
woman because he wants healthy kids.

26
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,433
And a young woman, like yourself...

27
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:36,848
...looks for a successful man
like Jason because she wants to feel safe.

28
00:03:38,944 --> 00:03:41,649
Jason has some spinach in his teeth.

29
00:03:44,075 --> 00:03:45,106
Thanks.

30
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:50,699
Anyway, and so the species survives.

31
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:56,209
What else is there, really, in the end?

32
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,249
In the end.

33
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,002
Well...

34
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:02,170
...there's the check.

35
00:04:02,969 --> 00:04:04,546
-Check, please.
-yes.

36
00:04:04,762 --> 00:04:07,051
-Could you get my car?
-Of course.

37
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:08,545
Thank you.

38
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:11,136
No dessert?

39
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:15,061
No, I'm sorry. I have finals.

40
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:16,690
That's too bad.

41
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,726
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

42
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,280
Muy expensivo.

43
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:27,780
Let's see, you had the salmon...

44
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:32,413
...and the crab cocktail.
I had the chicken and the salad.

45
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,368
And that would be....

46
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,371
Right.

47
00:04:37,795 --> 00:04:41,045
Okay, well. Thank you, Jason.
It was nice to meet you.

48
00:04:41,716 --> 00:04:43,210
What, that's it?

49
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:45,669
-What's it?
-Don't I get a kiss?

50
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:48,550
-Excuse me?
-Just a little fricking kiss.

51
00:04:48,765 --> 00:04:49,844
Oh, God.

52
00:04:50,058 --> 00:04:52,679
This hard-to-get shit
doesn't play with Jason.

53
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:56,353
Jason, I'm not a doctor yet...

54
00:04:56,564 --> 00:05:00,609
...but it's my considered opinion
you seek psychiatric help...

55
00:05:00,819 --> 00:05:02,277
...soon.

56
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,282
Says you!

57
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:17,117
Jason likes your dress.

58
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:12,508
Okay, Chad, it's just you and me now.

59
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,641
I promise to be gentle.

60
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:18,804
Oh, the strong, silent type.

61
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,023
How refreshing.

62
00:06:34,663 --> 00:06:37,154
Transversus abdominus.

63
00:06:39,167 --> 00:06:40,710
Someone there?

64
00:06:43,255 --> 00:06:44,453
Hello?

65
00:06:52,222 --> 00:06:53,503
Hello?

66
00:07:42,022 --> 00:07:44,692
-Oh, my God!
-you scared the shit out of me.

67
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:46,222
Sorry.

68
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,815
Oh, wow.

69
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:52,196
It's awfully late.
Will you be okay in here all alone?

70
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,944
Oh, yeah, I've got Chad. My corpse.

71
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:03,793
Good luck tomorrow.

72
00:08:03,878 --> 00:08:05,917
-Thanks. you, too.
-Thanks.

73
00:08:19,143 --> 00:08:22,060
"The journey of love is an arduous trek

74
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:27,105
"My love grows for you
as you bleed from your neck"

75
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:35,784
That's nice.

76
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:37,945
That's really nice.

77
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:13,276
Okay.

78
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:54,732
Oh, my God! Stop!

79
00:09:54,948 --> 00:09:55,943
Shit!

80
00:09:56,282 --> 00:09:57,990
Stop fucking around.

81
00:13:10,853 --> 00:13:13,724
Come on, Kate, you promised!

82
00:13:13,939 --> 00:13:18,103
Paige, today at work I wrote a column
about computer monitor dust wipes.

83
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:21,860
-Isn't that enough pain for one day?
-This isn't painful.

84
00:13:22,073 --> 00:13:23,483
Painful is blind dating...

85
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:27,531
...or meeting someone on the lnternet
and finding out 6-foot-ish is really--

86
00:13:27,745 --> 00:13:30,236
5'4" with loafers, I know.

87
00:13:30,706 --> 00:13:34,040
Kate, you'll meet 30 guys tonight.

88
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:38,373
you get 30 seconds apiece,
unless you want more. It's brilliant.

89
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,173
It'll be fun.

90
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:43,419
I haven't really completely broken up
with Adam yet.

91
00:13:43,636 --> 00:13:47,005
But you will. Believe me,
relationships don't make U-turns...

92
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:48,675
...and Adam's a drunk.

93
00:13:48,891 --> 00:13:50,172
He's not a drunk.

94
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:52,966
He's a borderline addictive personality...

95
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,939
...who happens to like alcohol a lot.

96
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:59,646
All right, fine. Let's just do it already.

97
00:14:03,698 --> 00:14:06,782
My mother's family dates back
to the Mayflower.

98
00:14:06,993 --> 00:14:08,701
I traced it myself.

99
00:14:09,203 --> 00:14:10,911
She makes her own turtlenecks.

100
00:14:11,122 --> 00:14:12,581
She had nine children.

101
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,700
Awesome, huh? She's....

102
00:14:15,668 --> 00:14:18,669
She's a pretty amazing woman.

103
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:25,047
Left me out of the goddamn blue.

104
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:27,220
Says she can do better.

105
00:14:27,847 --> 00:14:29,010
Says...

106
00:14:29,224 --> 00:14:31,216
...l don't fulfill her needs...

107
00:14:31,434 --> 00:14:32,928
...sexually.

108
00:14:33,853 --> 00:14:35,561
It's obvious to me.

109
00:14:35,772 --> 00:14:37,480
The girl's got to be a dyke.

110
00:14:37,982 --> 00:14:42,229
Greatest team in the history
of professional football: 49ers!

111
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,692
The Bible.

112
00:14:44,906 --> 00:14:47,741
The Bible is the foundation
of morality and marriage.

113
00:14:57,043 --> 00:14:58,502
I know what you're thinking.

114
00:14:58,712 --> 00:15:01,748
-you do?
-you want to get the hell out of here.

115
00:15:02,382 --> 00:15:03,413
That's pretty good.

116
00:15:09,472 --> 00:15:10,504
Hi there.

117
00:15:11,266 --> 00:15:12,380
Hi there.

118
00:15:13,518 --> 00:15:14,549
I'm Paige.

119
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:16,467
Brian.

120
00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:22,401
Brian, did my friend mention
that she's in a serious relationship?

121
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,562
No, actually, she didn't.

122
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:28,609
But I'm free.

123
00:15:32,287 --> 00:15:34,078
you're appalling, you know that?

124
00:15:34,247 --> 00:15:38,743
-Hey, you had your thirty seconds.
-Twenty-four. you took my last six.

125
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,165
Hello.

126
00:15:41,755 --> 00:15:44,709
Dorothy, you won't believe
what Paige made me do.

127
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:46,039
What?

128
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,429
Oh, my God.

129
00:15:50,806 --> 00:15:51,885
What?

130
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,885
Shelley Fisher was taken
long before her time.

131
00:15:57,104 --> 00:16:00,058
We mourn not her loss, but ours.

132
00:16:00,607 --> 00:16:03,810
And so this is the time
for those of us left behind...

133
00:16:04,027 --> 00:16:05,936
...to share our burden.

134
00:16:06,446 --> 00:16:10,444
I never know what to do
in situations like this. I'm really bad at it.

135
00:16:11,618 --> 00:16:15,153
I know that we're supposed
to be taking a break and all.

136
00:16:15,372 --> 00:16:17,780
I just thought you needed a friend.

137
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:20,578
I'm glad you're here.

138
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:23,458
So....

139
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:27,091
What do I do?

140
00:16:28,635 --> 00:16:30,794
I'm sorry.

141
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:34,759
Hey.

142
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,549
Front page.

143
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,478
Kate, that's for Spencer Marks.

144
00:16:48,697 --> 00:16:53,240
you remember.
We both started on the paper together.

145
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,867
He just got lead reporter on the Giants...

146
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:59,916
...so I got it for him as a gift. That's all.

147
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:02,950
Okay.

148
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:06,665
-I'm sorry. It doesn't matter.
-Of course it matters.

149
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:09,717
Look, I haven't touched a thing
in three weeks.

150
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:13,171
I'm doing really good, Kate.

151
00:17:18,936 --> 00:17:21,937
you think that we can get together
this week?

152
00:17:22,147 --> 00:17:23,690
Dinner or something?

153
00:17:25,401 --> 00:17:28,817
-I don't know.
-It's just dinner, not a marriage proposal.

154
00:17:28,988 --> 00:17:30,980
Adam, the last time we had dinner...

155
00:17:31,156 --> 00:17:33,992
...we ended up
in a Lake Tahoe hotel for three days.

156
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,702
Oh, yeah, right.

157
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:36,990
That.

158
00:17:37,955 --> 00:17:39,533
-That.
-yeah.

159
00:17:46,422 --> 00:17:49,091
-I'll call you, okay?
-yeah.

160
00:18:26,087 --> 00:18:27,711
He looks good, huh?

161
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:30,793
Kate, that boy always looks good.

162
00:18:32,969 --> 00:18:34,214
Was that Adam?

163
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:36,468
Don't give me a hard time right now.

164
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:37,961
Sorry.

165
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:39,842
Jesus, Paige, it's a funeral.

166
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:41,257
What?

167
00:18:44,188 --> 00:18:46,395
Did you see the police are here?

168
00:18:46,566 --> 00:18:47,561
I know.

169
00:18:47,775 --> 00:18:49,269
So awful.

170
00:18:50,528 --> 00:18:52,984
How are you doing, Lily? Are you okay?

171
00:18:53,239 --> 00:18:54,484
I don't know.

172
00:18:55,116 --> 00:18:57,025
I can't believe she's gone.

173
00:18:58,369 --> 00:18:59,532
Excuse me, ladies.

174
00:18:59,746 --> 00:19:02,949
I'm Detective Vaughn.
Are you friends of Shelley?

175
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,123
We've known her since we were kids.

176
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:07,043
Okay if I ask a few questions?

177
00:19:07,253 --> 00:19:08,249
-Sure.
-yeah.

178
00:19:08,421 --> 00:19:10,378
When did you last see her?

179
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,292
About a year ago.

180
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:14,459
-More like two for me.
-Same here.

181
00:19:14,761 --> 00:19:16,967
She was really busy with med school.

182
00:19:18,097 --> 00:19:20,386
you know anyone named Jason Marquette?

183
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,679
Who's that?

184
00:19:21,768 --> 00:19:25,137
Shelley was with him the night she died.
Now he's missing.

185
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:30,651
Listen, ladies.

186
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:34,103
you think of anything, anyone...

187
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:36,822
...just give me a call.

188
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:42,571
Okay, ladies. Take care.

189
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,279
Thanks.

190
00:20:10,317 --> 00:20:12,309
"Roses are red

191
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,402
"Violets are blue

192
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:19,065
"They'll need dental records
to identify you! "

193
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,291
Hey, Dorothy.

194
00:20:28,251 --> 00:20:29,959
Hey, Campbell.

195
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:33,375
Come in.

196
00:20:41,098 --> 00:20:43,304
Cozy little place you have.

197
00:20:43,975 --> 00:20:45,635
Is everything okay?

198
00:20:47,396 --> 00:20:49,887
Actually, I feel a little weird about this.

199
00:20:50,107 --> 00:20:52,811
I tried calling you earlier,
but you weren't home.

200
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:54,728
I need to ask a favor.

201
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,934
Sure.

202
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:59,025
My roommate left town
without paying his share of the rent.

203
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:03,108
When I got home today, all my stuff
had been thrown out on the sidewalk.

204
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,449
Skis, CDs, clothes, everything just gone.

205
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:09,334
The timing couldn't be worse.
Every penny I have...

206
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,660
...is invested in this startup.

207
00:21:14,006 --> 00:21:15,381
Millie?

208
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:18,003
Millie!

209
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:23,421
-Can you please make up a guest room?
-No, I couldn't--

210
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,801
-Did your father say?
-No. I said.

211
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:33,479
-Dorothy, I'm embarrassed about this--
-Don't be ridiculous.

212
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:37,270
Go get yourself settled in,
and I will be right there.

213
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,109
you are the best.

214
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,527
-Thanks.
-you're welcome.

215
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:54,039
Who's your friend?

216
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:57,297
He's Campbell.
I met him at yoga and he's off-limits.

217
00:21:57,508 --> 00:21:59,666
Let my dad know he's staying here.

218
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,512
Is he the reason
you're always on the treadmill?

219
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,010
Kim, you're not my girlfriend
or my mother.

220
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,466
I'm just taking an interest in your life.

221
00:22:07,685 --> 00:22:09,511
you know, as your stepmom.

222
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:13,726
When you're old enough to rent a car,
we can discuss your role as my stepmom.

223
00:22:13,941 --> 00:22:16,610
In the meantime,
don't talk about my sex life.

224
00:22:16,819 --> 00:22:18,858
you have a sex life?

225
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,610
I do. And I don't charge
by the hour like you.

226
00:22:23,242 --> 00:22:24,701
How dare you!

227
00:22:24,785 --> 00:22:27,952
Get your hands off me,
you mail-order bride from hell!

228
00:22:28,038 --> 00:22:29,616
Hey, break it up, you two!

229
00:22:29,832 --> 00:22:33,616
She just called me
"a mail-order bride from hell."

230
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:34,951
Dorothy.

231
00:22:35,045 --> 00:22:36,955
Who knows what she just called me?

232
00:22:38,966 --> 00:22:40,709
It's okay, sweetheart.

233
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:44,596
you have to show
more respect to my wife.

234
00:22:47,058 --> 00:22:48,849
But, Dad! She--

235
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,165
Hello?

236
00:23:33,396 --> 00:23:34,558
Hello?

237
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,836
Not today!

238
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:19,180
It's Murray the super. Leave a message.

239
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,642
Murray, it's Kate in 403.

240
00:24:21,861 --> 00:24:25,645
I don't have any water,
and I need to be at work in half an hour.

241
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:27,657
I've got crap in my hair and--

242
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:29,278
Damn it!

243
00:24:32,122 --> 00:24:34,328
Murray, are you there?

244
00:25:11,286 --> 00:25:13,279
Perfect timing, Murray.

245
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:14,993
Hello?

246
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,495
Hello?

247
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,531
Hello, Kate.

248
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,287
Hi, Gary.

249
00:26:01,503 --> 00:26:03,709
you look great, Kate.

250
00:26:04,381 --> 00:26:06,374
How about a date, Kate?

251
00:26:06,717 --> 00:26:08,175
you can be my mate, Kate.

252
00:26:08,719 --> 00:26:10,546
you're scary, Gary.

253
00:26:12,347 --> 00:26:14,885
This could be our fate, Kate.

254
00:26:17,394 --> 00:26:18,473
Hey there, Lily.

255
00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:20,062
Hey there yourself.

256
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,350
Than큝 you for requesting my tape.
My name is Lance.

257
00:26:23,567 --> 00:26:24,563
Hello, Lance.

258
00:26:24,735 --> 00:26:26,858
I thin큝 I'm perfect for you.

259
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,068
I'm outgoing, I'm fun, I'm 6-foot-ish.

260
00:26:32,868 --> 00:26:34,446
I li큝e board games.

261
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:38,201
I play a lot of ocean sports.
You 큝now, 큝aya큝--

262
00:26:38,749 --> 00:26:40,208
Goodbye, Lance.

263
00:26:40,417 --> 00:26:42,743
Better luck next time, Lance.

264
00:26:51,011 --> 00:26:52,387
Who is it?

265
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,469
Who is it?

266
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:58,677
There's nobody there!

267
00:26:58,769 --> 00:27:01,853
It's probably Lance.
He doesn't clear the peephole.

268
00:27:05,943 --> 00:27:07,354
Hello!

269
00:27:13,117 --> 00:27:15,442
-That's strange.
-They were fast.

270
00:27:17,204 --> 00:27:19,826
I bet it's from Max.

271
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,748
The rose.

272
00:27:21,959 --> 00:27:23,916
Valentine.

273
00:27:24,003 --> 00:27:25,248
Let's see it.

274
00:27:30,468 --> 00:27:33,967
"'Tis a well-known fact
that beauty is skin deep

275
00:27:34,138 --> 00:27:37,472
"Savor the taste
you are what you eat"

276
00:27:38,017 --> 00:27:40,009
Well, that's sweet. I think.

277
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:42,683
It's the strangest valentine I've ever seen.

278
00:27:43,439 --> 00:27:46,642
Oh, look. It's not from Max. Look, "J.M."

279
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:48,477
-Must be for you.
-Why?

280
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:52,437
you've covered much more
of the alphabet than I have. Who's J.M.?

281
00:27:52,657 --> 00:27:54,863
Bite me. It's definitely for you.

282
00:27:55,284 --> 00:27:56,565
Okay.

283
00:27:56,953 --> 00:28:00,072
you say it's for me, it's for me.

284
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,679
-John McCrite.
-Never even made a pass at me.

285
00:28:24,188 --> 00:28:25,682
Jeff Mallick?

286
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:28,983
Not his style. Jake Matheson.

287
00:28:29,193 --> 00:28:30,189
Gay.

288
00:28:30,403 --> 00:28:33,439
Who was the guy who sent you
the computer virus?

289
00:28:33,573 --> 00:28:35,530
Beckett Broda.

290
00:28:35,742 --> 00:28:38,233
Damn. J.M.

291
00:28:40,163 --> 00:28:41,823
Jeremy Melton?

292
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:43,498
Who's Jeremy Melton?

293
00:28:43,708 --> 00:28:45,202
I'm kidding.

294
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:46,996
No, who's Jeremy Melton?

295
00:28:47,211 --> 00:28:49,251
Come on! Sixth grade.

296
00:28:50,006 --> 00:28:52,378
Pervert. Sixty pounds.

297
00:28:52,467 --> 00:28:55,670
Buck teeth. "you look so pretty, Paige! "

298
00:28:59,557 --> 00:29:02,558
-He can't still live in town, can he?
-Lily, I'm kidding!

299
00:29:02,769 --> 00:29:06,813
No, I know, it's just....
What do you think happened to him?

300
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:09,348
I don't know. What does it matter?

301
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:10,854
It doesn't.

302
00:29:12,111 --> 00:29:14,863
God, we were so horrible to that kid.

303
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:16,276
Whatever.

304
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:19,741
All I know is that was nasty.

305
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,200
I'm talking maggots.
Actual live worms inside the chocolate.

306
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:31,378
At least he left it at the door.

307
00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:34,127
I swear there was someone
in my apartment.

308
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:36,916
you must have left your door unlocked.

309
00:29:37,012 --> 00:29:39,300
We were all so looped when we left.

310
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:42,888
But it still freaked me out.
you should've seen this mask.

311
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:45,719
Look what we have here.

312
00:29:47,939 --> 00:29:49,481
He's subtle.

313
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,855
Well?

314
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:55,772
you want to come over?

315
00:29:59,784 --> 00:30:01,409
I guess not.

316
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:05,453
-'Bye!
-Hey, guys.

317
00:30:06,082 --> 00:30:07,790
This is Max.

318
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:09,156
Hi, Max. I'm Kate.

319
00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:11,587
Hello, Kate.

320
00:30:12,297 --> 00:30:13,756
That will do, Max.

321
00:30:13,924 --> 00:30:16,165
I'm just being polite, Paige.

322
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:19,172
So, isn't the show great?

323
00:30:19,387 --> 00:30:21,261
yeah, it's great. Cheers.

324
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:23,425
Better than your last one.

325
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,054
you hate it.

326
00:30:25,644 --> 00:30:27,221
No.

327
00:30:27,479 --> 00:30:30,646
It's all right. I hate it too, sometimes.

328
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:33,771
But an artist has got to explore.

329
00:30:33,944 --> 00:30:38,570
Max, I'm sorry. We're having trouble
with the video playback in the maze.

330
00:30:38,782 --> 00:30:40,324
Christ.

331
00:30:42,035 --> 00:30:43,494
Forgive me.

332
00:30:47,249 --> 00:30:48,411
Girl.

333
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:55,248
I'll be right back, you guys.

334
00:31:00,262 --> 00:31:02,301
-Hi!
-Hello.

335
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:03,670
I'm Paige.

336
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:05,425
Hi, Paige. I'm Campbell.

337
00:31:05,601 --> 00:31:09,978
So, what brings you to this fascinating
cultural event, Campbell?

338
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:12,644
That's a very good question.
I'm here with--

339
00:31:12,858 --> 00:31:15,775
Hi, guys! I see you've met Campbell.

340
00:31:15,944 --> 00:31:17,604
Paige was just hitting on him.

341
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,938
Sorry, I didn't know.

342
00:31:20,115 --> 00:31:23,733
Campbell, this is Kate and Lily,
and I see you've already met Paige.

343
00:31:23,827 --> 00:31:25,405
Nice to meet all of you.

344
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:27,821
We all had headgear and braces together.

345
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,041
Really? you all seem
to have turned out all right.

346
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,038
-Can I get you a drink?
-yes, please.

347
00:31:40,177 --> 00:31:43,628
Dorothy, what else
have you been keeping to yourself?.

348
00:31:43,806 --> 00:31:45,300
Valentine's Day.

349
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:47,385
What does it mean?

350
00:31:47,977 --> 00:31:51,761
What's it really about?
Celebration of true love?

351
00:31:51,981 --> 00:31:55,515
It was really strange.
A cupid mask, like a cherub.

352
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:57,898
Like at that Valentine's Day dance?

353
00:31:57,987 --> 00:31:59,149
What dance?

354
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:03,110
Junior high. God, Jeremy Melton.

355
00:32:03,325 --> 00:32:08,320
Oh, my God, this is so weird. We were
just talking about him this afternoon.

356
00:32:12,168 --> 00:32:14,160
So, ladies and gentlemen...

357
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:16,709
...l hope you enjoy your blind date.

358
00:32:17,173 --> 00:32:21,585
If you would, I need the ladies to go
to the left and the men to the right.

359
00:32:22,678 --> 00:32:24,967
Ladies one side, men the other.

360
00:32:32,313 --> 00:32:35,230
Ladies one side, men the other.

361
00:32:44,533 --> 00:32:46,028
What do you li큝e to do?

362
00:32:46,702 --> 00:32:48,825
What do you li큝e to do?

363
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:50,153
Wow.

364
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:52,661
-What is wrong with this guy?
-Dorothy!

365
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:54,453
-Look at that one.
-Sorry.

366
00:32:56,462 --> 00:32:58,585
What do you li큝e to do?

367
00:32:59,215 --> 00:33:01,540
What do you li큝e to do?

368
00:33:04,554 --> 00:33:07,127
This is like a lingerie commercial.

369
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:11,134
That's his point. It's art. Just keep going.

370
00:33:18,651 --> 00:33:20,145
Love me.

371
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:22,189
Love me.

372
00:33:22,697 --> 00:33:23,977
Love me.

373
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,069
Love me.

374
00:33:26,576 --> 00:33:27,904
Love me.

375
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:35,865
Guys?

376
00:34:11,162 --> 00:34:13,534
-What?
-Who's that?

377
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,156
Hey, Amy.

378
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:19,628
That's Amy.

379
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:22,755
What do you mean, "that's Amy"?
Get her out of here!

380
00:34:23,383 --> 00:34:24,794
But I invited her here.

381
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,172
Excuse me?

382
00:34:28,596 --> 00:34:32,179
-Jesus, relax.
-What the hell are you doing?

383
00:34:32,976 --> 00:34:35,182
It's not like we're in junior high school.

384
00:34:37,355 --> 00:34:38,731
Look, I have to go.

385
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:41,602
I have an early flight tomorrow.
Forget this!

386
00:34:41,693 --> 00:34:44,896
-Great. What's the matter?
-"What's the matter?"

387
00:34:45,113 --> 00:34:50,238
The problem is, you turned out to be
a cheap, hypocritical sleazeball.

388
00:34:50,452 --> 00:34:52,943
yeah, but you knew that.

389
00:34:57,292 --> 00:34:59,913
So, does this mean you won't be
my valentine?

390
00:36:19,416 --> 00:36:22,203
I said I want my money back.

391
00:36:22,336 --> 00:36:24,293
Hey, leech, I'm talking to you.

392
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:26,332
I don't know what you're talking--

393
00:36:26,507 --> 00:36:28,334
-Oh, really?
-That's right.

394
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,294
-Is everything okay?
-yeah.

395
00:36:30,511 --> 00:36:34,010
-If it isn't the latest victim.
-Excuse me, who are you?

396
00:36:34,098 --> 00:36:36,933
-That's none of your business.
-She's no one.

397
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:38,257
No one.

398
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:42,397
Just the idiot who's still waiting
for the return on her lnternet investment.

399
00:36:42,606 --> 00:36:45,691
What did you call that again?
"Bleed-me-dry.com"?

400
00:36:45,776 --> 00:36:48,018
That's nice. Let's go, Dorothy.

401
00:36:48,821 --> 00:36:51,526
Watch your back, leech.

402
00:36:52,825 --> 00:36:55,031
-Sorry I didn't go.
-you didn't miss much.

403
00:36:55,202 --> 00:36:58,239
Except for some crazy woman
attacking Dorothy's boyfriend.

404
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:00,033
And some really bad art.

405
00:37:00,207 --> 00:37:02,330
The stuff was basically porn.

406
00:37:02,418 --> 00:37:03,746
Sounds okay.

407
00:37:06,922 --> 00:37:09,840
Things have just been really weird lately.

408
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:12,886
Today, I find this cupid mask
in the elevator.

409
00:37:13,095 --> 00:37:16,678
I turn around and there's
my creepy neighbor leering at me.

410
00:37:16,932 --> 00:37:19,720
"Don't be late, Kate.
you're first rate, Kate." Him?

411
00:37:19,894 --> 00:37:21,471
yeah, him.

412
00:37:22,021 --> 00:37:25,935
Every time I do laundry, he's there.
Day, night, it doesn't matter.

413
00:37:27,443 --> 00:37:28,818
Knock it off.

414
00:37:29,236 --> 00:37:31,609
yesterday, my underwear was missing.

415
00:37:31,697 --> 00:37:33,489
Don't worry, that was me.

416
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:36,154
I like to try them on, you know?

417
00:37:36,244 --> 00:37:39,659
Makes me feel free.
Tap into my, you know, feminine side.

418
00:37:39,872 --> 00:37:42,790
-What's it gonna be tonight?
-Can I have a Corona?

419
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,744
Just a club soda, please.

420
00:37:45,503 --> 00:37:47,294
Actually, make that two.

421
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,044
So...

422
00:37:55,346 --> 00:37:56,840
...what do you say?

423
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:02,353
I'm just asking you for a chance, that's all.

424
00:38:03,104 --> 00:38:04,895
I want to, Adam...

425
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:10,774
...but you drink, and you get
out of control, and it scares me.

426
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:13,692
I've stopped. I've changed.

427
00:38:13,906 --> 00:38:16,480
So, it won't make a difference if you wait.

428
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:24,745
Right.

429
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:29,373
I don't get it. We told you
we haven't seen Shelley in over a year.

430
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:32,080
-How are we gonna help you?
-Humor me.

431
00:38:32,884 --> 00:38:35,007
Wasn't there another one of you?

432
00:38:35,261 --> 00:38:36,257
Lily.

433
00:38:36,471 --> 00:38:38,013
She's out of town.

434
00:38:41,142 --> 00:38:43,847
These are remembrance cards
sent to the parents.

435
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:45,307
Look at this.

436
00:38:45,396 --> 00:38:46,974
It's odd.

437
00:38:53,488 --> 00:38:54,768
J.M.

438
00:38:58,952 --> 00:39:02,570
-Jeremy Melton, jeez.
-Who's Jeremy Melton?

439
00:39:02,664 --> 00:39:04,953
This loser from sixth grade.

440
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:07,289
-He and Shelley were friends?
-No.

441
00:39:07,377 --> 00:39:09,868
We haven't seen him in years.
Why would he send a card?

442
00:39:09,963 --> 00:39:11,422
Because it's him.

443
00:39:12,632 --> 00:39:14,126
It's Jeremy.

444
00:39:15,093 --> 00:39:17,382
I got an awful valentine the other day...

445
00:39:17,595 --> 00:39:20,003
...saying they were
gonna kill me, signed "J.M."

446
00:39:20,223 --> 00:39:22,631
Ours, too. The card and our chocolates.

447
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,059
you both received threatening notes
signed "J.M."?

448
00:39:27,272 --> 00:39:31,104
I say I'm looking for a Jason Marquette,
you don't mention it?

449
00:39:31,651 --> 00:39:33,311
I thought it was a joke.

450
00:39:33,486 --> 00:39:34,862
Okay.

451
00:39:34,946 --> 00:39:36,571
Why would Jeremy want to hurt you?

452
00:39:36,781 --> 00:39:40,826
He attacked me at a dance.
He got sent to reform school because of it.

453
00:39:40,994 --> 00:39:45,039
That explains why he threatened you.
But why Shelley? Why your friends?

454
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:48,416
-I don't know, but he is.
-you don't know that.

455
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:50,957
Some kid that you teased
in the sixth grade...

456
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:54,207
...is probably not worth
getting all worked up over.

457
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:02,173
But I'll go check it out anyway.

458
00:40:03,517 --> 00:40:05,094
you do that.

459
00:40:06,686 --> 00:40:09,890
-I'm next. I know I'm next.
-What are you talking about?

460
00:40:09,981 --> 00:40:13,101
Because Jeremy got sent
to reform school because of me.

461
00:40:13,193 --> 00:40:15,186
Dorothy, he attacked you.

462
00:40:16,613 --> 00:40:18,024
Dorothy.

463
00:40:21,034 --> 00:40:23,988
He did attack you, right?

464
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:26,612
No.

465
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,155
He didn't.

466
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:33,330
-I just said that he did.
-Why would you do that?

467
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:36,713
you guys wouldn't understand.

468
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:41,052
Do you remember
what I looked like back then?

469
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:44,050
you were bigger.

470
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:46,516
you were big-boned.

471
00:40:46,852 --> 00:40:50,684
-you were plump.
-I was fat, okay?

472
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:53,727
The only guy that looked at me
that night was Jeremy.

473
00:40:53,901 --> 00:40:56,474
And when those guys came up
and saw us making out...

474
00:40:56,695 --> 00:40:58,902
...l couldn't bear it and so...

475
00:40:59,698 --> 00:41:01,157
...l lied.

476
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:03,324
And I said he attacked me.

477
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:06,537
Why didn't you say something about this
to Vaughn?

478
00:41:06,914 --> 00:41:08,372
I just couldn't.

479
00:41:09,249 --> 00:41:12,203
Dorothy, I really wouldn't worry about this.

480
00:41:12,419 --> 00:41:16,084
Jeremy Melton couldn't manage
a water fountain without screwing up.

481
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:19,756
I don't think he's capable
of an intricate revenge plot.

482
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,360
you scared me! What are you doing here?

483
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:49,117
-I thought we were having dinner.
-We are?

484
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:53,743
We are. I'm sorry. I completely forgot.

485
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:56,001
I'm just a little distracted.

486
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:57,411
What's up?

487
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,213
It's probably nothing.

488
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:02,881
you wouldn't believe me if I told you.

489
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,214
you think it's far-fetched?

490
00:42:05,306 --> 00:42:08,757
This whole Jeremy Melton
Revenge of the Nerds theory.

491
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,139
I don't know.

492
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:15,930
What should I do?

493
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:21,227
I'm thinking Mexico, the two of us,
until this all blows over.

494
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:25,487
Well.

495
00:42:29,622 --> 00:42:31,745
-you want to come up?
-yeah, I do.

496
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,333
Believe me.

497
00:42:44,804 --> 00:42:46,132
I do.

498
00:42:47,682 --> 00:42:48,880
But....

499
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:50,802
I don't want you to do something...

500
00:42:50,977 --> 00:42:54,061
...that you'll write off
as a weak moment tomorrow.

501
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:57,148
So get upstairs before I lose my will.

502
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:07,856
Don't worry about it, all right?

503
00:43:08,036 --> 00:43:10,194
Everything's gonna be all right.

504
00:43:16,377 --> 00:43:20,707
First, you guys get Melton
shipped off to reform school.

505
00:43:20,924 --> 00:43:23,545
A year later, he lands in juvenile hall.

506
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:26,636
Six months after that,
a state-run mental hospital.

507
00:43:26,721 --> 00:43:28,263
That's awful.

508
00:43:28,514 --> 00:43:30,887
you must have done some number on him.

509
00:43:33,353 --> 00:43:34,728
Where is he now?

510
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:38,722
All we know is that his parents died
in a fire a couple years back.

511
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:41,853
-Was he involved?
-I don't know. Ruled an accident.

512
00:43:42,070 --> 00:43:44,109
I want to show you something.

513
00:43:44,197 --> 00:43:47,696
I pulled a file photo,
and I ran some enhancements.

514
00:43:54,541 --> 00:43:55,951
Here we go.

515
00:43:56,334 --> 00:43:57,745
That's him.

516
00:43:57,919 --> 00:43:59,082
Right.

517
00:43:59,587 --> 00:44:01,876
But know anybody that looks like this?

518
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,049
Or this?

519
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:06,218
Or this?

520
00:44:07,595 --> 00:44:08,710
Or this.

521
00:44:09,806 --> 00:44:11,799
Brown contacts, blue, green...

522
00:44:12,017 --> 00:44:14,804
...beard, goatee, mustache?
Ten years is a long time.

523
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,855
And there's the possibility
of plastic surgery.

524
00:44:17,939 --> 00:44:20,228
Do you have more recent photos?

525
00:44:22,402 --> 00:44:24,774
Don't you think we'd be looking at them?

526
00:44:24,863 --> 00:44:28,314
The point is, this could be anyone.
Where's your friend Lily?

527
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:30,740
We told you. She's in L.A.

528
00:44:32,037 --> 00:44:34,243
What do you know about Max Raimi?

529
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:37,706
Just that he is an artist. A bad one.

530
00:44:39,461 --> 00:44:41,703
I know, I've seen his work.

531
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:45,044
What about the rest of you?
Any boyfriends?

532
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,174
Paige, for example?

533
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:54,463
The short answer is no.

534
00:44:56,603 --> 00:44:58,014
What about you?

535
00:44:59,564 --> 00:45:02,482
Sort of. But I've known him a while.

536
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:03,943
Meaning what?

537
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:06,690
Meaning, we used to work
at the same paper.

538
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,239
He covers the Giants.

539
00:45:08,323 --> 00:45:13,281
His mother is a lawyer, his father
is a teacher. They're from Seattle.

540
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:15,067
How's that?

541
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:19,207
What about you?

542
00:45:19,459 --> 00:45:20,918
I have a boyfriend.

543
00:45:21,086 --> 00:45:24,170
But I can guarantee you
he's not Jeremy Melton.

544
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:28,339
-Why don't you let me decide?
-His name is Campbell.

545
00:45:28,802 --> 00:45:32,752
And he's very smart.
He's starting his own lnternet venture.

546
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:34,675
How long have you known him?

547
00:45:34,766 --> 00:45:37,471
-A month.
-Where did you meet him?

548
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:42,558
At yoga.
But it's a very exclusive gym, okay?

549
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:45,604
Wait.

550
00:45:45,986 --> 00:45:48,477
I thought Campbell is staying with you.

551
00:45:49,198 --> 00:45:50,478
Well, he is.

552
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:53,321
His roommate didn't pay the rent, so....

553
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:57,948
Dorothy, you met this guy a month ago
and he's staying with you?

554
00:45:58,457 --> 00:46:01,458
There have been guys
whose last names you didn't know...

555
00:46:01,669 --> 00:46:05,797
...that you let into your pants.
I'm just letting this guy into my house.

556
00:46:05,965 --> 00:46:07,672
you don't have to be bitchy.

557
00:46:07,883 --> 00:46:09,046
Fine.

558
00:46:10,052 --> 00:46:13,088
So while we're on the topic, Dorothy...

559
00:46:13,305 --> 00:46:15,428
...what is Campbell's last name?

560
00:46:21,897 --> 00:46:25,147
you know, that's it. This is bullshit.

561
00:46:25,317 --> 00:46:27,987
I don't have to answer these questions.

562
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:30,231
I'll see you guys later.

563
00:46:35,661 --> 00:46:37,239
That went well.

564
00:46:39,373 --> 00:46:41,911
-I got to go.
-Me, too.

565
00:46:43,002 --> 00:46:46,122
Paige, actually,
I'd like you to stay a moment.

566
00:46:46,505 --> 00:46:49,079
Am I in trouble, detective?

567
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,835
-you want to interrogate me?
-It will just take a second.

568
00:46:54,388 --> 00:46:57,140
-Talk later?
-Sure, if I'm not under arrest.

569
00:47:05,316 --> 00:47:06,858
Please take a seat.

570
00:47:18,371 --> 00:47:20,494
So, what are we gonna do about this?

571
00:47:20,706 --> 00:47:24,918
I thought that was your job.
you're the detective, right?

572
00:47:25,002 --> 00:47:27,042
I'm not talking about the case.

573
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:30,415
Don't be coy. I'm talking about this.

574
00:47:31,592 --> 00:47:32,624
This?

575
00:47:32,844 --> 00:47:34,172
Tension.

576
00:47:34,387 --> 00:47:35,881
The tension?

577
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,425
The sexual tension.

578
00:47:42,311 --> 00:47:43,889
Let's be frank.

579
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:51,728
Detective Vaughn,
please remove your hand from my thigh.

580
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:56,239
All right.
Where would you like me to put it?

581
00:47:56,951 --> 00:47:58,991
How about up your ass?

582
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,122
Have a good day.

583
00:48:08,713 --> 00:48:11,038
So, you'll get back to me on that?

584
00:48:35,907 --> 00:48:37,698
Who the fuck are you?

585
00:48:41,162 --> 00:48:43,653
It's not what it looks like, brother.

586
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,412
Take it easy. I am not well.

587
00:49:06,396 --> 00:49:07,890
Here you go.

588
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:17,696
Happy Valentine's Day.

589
00:49:17,782 --> 00:49:20,736
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-I came by to drop off a gift.

590
00:49:20,952 --> 00:49:24,286
I'd have been here earlier,
but I was with that detective.

591
00:49:24,915 --> 00:49:26,991
It was very romantic, actually.

592
00:49:27,083 --> 00:49:29,456
-I wanted to explain.
-Nothing to explain.

593
00:49:29,669 --> 00:49:33,881
-He's talking to everybody.
-Kate, don't worry about it.

594
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,926
Do you need a date
for Dorothy's party tonight?

595
00:49:37,552 --> 00:49:40,553
you don't want to go
to a Valentine's party alone.

596
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:42,759
True.

597
00:49:43,934 --> 00:49:45,594
So where's my gift?

598
00:49:51,817 --> 00:49:53,525
I picked it out myself.

599
00:49:53,735 --> 00:49:55,527
It's very cute.

600
00:49:56,363 --> 00:49:58,237
I got you something, too.

601
00:50:03,287 --> 00:50:05,778
-you got my suit cleaned.
-Turn around.

602
00:50:13,797 --> 00:50:16,122
"IOU TLC"

603
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:18,292
This is outstanding.

604
00:50:18,468 --> 00:50:21,802
-I love that.
-Can't get that at the mall.

605
00:50:21,972 --> 00:50:23,300
Nope.

606
00:50:26,977 --> 00:50:28,222
'Bye.

607
00:51:00,386 --> 00:51:04,004
-What the hell are you doing?
-What are you doing here?

608
00:51:04,223 --> 00:51:07,390
Detective Vaughn is a disgusting,
lecherous scumbag.

609
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:10,935
-What happened?
-After you left he put his hand on my thigh.

610
00:51:11,272 --> 00:51:14,273
-Did you ask him to?
-What do you think?

611
00:51:14,859 --> 00:51:16,234
I don't know.

612
00:51:19,613 --> 00:51:21,440
-Hello?
-It's Dorothy.

613
00:51:21,657 --> 00:51:24,492
Hold on, Dorothy. Paige is here, too.

614
00:51:26,662 --> 00:51:28,073
Hey, Dorothy.

615
00:51:28,289 --> 00:51:31,124
Kate nearly clubbed me
on the head with an iron.

616
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:33,207
They came for Campbell.

617
00:51:33,419 --> 00:51:35,411
I 큝now. They questioned Adam, too.

618
00:51:35,629 --> 00:51:39,378
Did they call Adam
or did they question him for two hours?

619
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,884
They've requested that Campbell
not leave town for a few days.

620
00:51:43,095 --> 00:51:44,755
It's humiliating.

621
00:51:46,015 --> 00:51:47,842
Did you give Vaughn his name?

622
00:51:47,933 --> 00:51:48,929
No!

623
00:51:49,143 --> 00:51:50,934
Then how did he get it?

624
00:51:51,145 --> 00:51:52,853
He's a detective.

625
00:51:53,189 --> 00:51:57,187
You go bac큝 and forth about Adam.
"Should I or shouldn't l?"

626
00:51:57,401 --> 00:51:59,193
Campbell is all I've got.

627
00:51:59,403 --> 00:52:01,729
I don't want to be dumped
before my party.

628
00:52:01,906 --> 00:52:06,117
Just hang up the phone
and make it up to the guy if he's so upset.

629
00:52:06,327 --> 00:52:07,786
What do you mean?

630
00:52:08,788 --> 00:52:10,864
Use your imagination.

631
00:52:11,749 --> 00:52:14,370
-Thanks, Paige.
-You're welcome.

632
00:52:17,213 --> 00:52:19,668
She's so ridiculous.

633
00:52:20,299 --> 00:52:24,463
-Do you need instructions?
-It's Detective Vaughn, Kate.

634
00:52:28,015 --> 00:52:29,474
Sorry, detective.

635
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:32,643
Good news. We picked up Marquette.

636
00:52:32,728 --> 00:52:36,098
-Does this mean that it's Jeremy?
-We haven't questioned him yet.

637
00:52:36,315 --> 00:52:38,641
But if it isn't Melton, you'll keep looking?

638
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:42,394
We'll 큝eep pursuing every angle.
Meantime, be careful.

639
00:52:42,613 --> 00:52:46,481
Stay with your friends.
I'll let you know when I have more.

640
00:52:46,576 --> 00:52:48,153
Thank you, detective.

641
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:51,777
Well?

642
00:52:52,498 --> 00:52:53,993
Picked up Marquette.

643
00:53:00,542 --> 00:53:02,618
What do we have here?

644
00:53:03,211 --> 00:53:06,046
Plan is to have this
up and running by tonight.

645
00:53:10,051 --> 00:53:12,340
I'm sorry about this morning.

646
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:16,094
Don't even worry about it, really.
It's not a big deal.

647
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:22,222
Happy Valentine's Day.

648
00:53:22,481 --> 00:53:24,189
Dorothy, what--

649
00:53:25,233 --> 00:53:27,855
I had no idea we were exchanging.

650
00:53:27,944 --> 00:53:30,898
I'm embarrassed. Do I open it?

651
00:53:34,534 --> 00:53:35,863
Put it on.

652
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:45,079
you like it?

653
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:46,997
Do I like it?

654
00:53:47,923 --> 00:53:50,378
-I love it.
-yeah?

655
00:54:19,955 --> 00:54:22,031
Don't worry about it.

656
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:24,118
It's just that--

657
00:54:30,132 --> 00:54:32,125
I'm gonna go take a shower.

658
00:54:43,395 --> 00:54:44,973
Now it's my turn.

659
00:54:54,823 --> 00:54:56,781
It's so beautiful.

660
00:55:00,663 --> 00:55:02,157
Thank you.

661
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,663
Listen, I have that investor meeting--

662
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:09,784
-you're leaving?
-Just for drinks. It'll be an hour, tops.

663
00:55:09,964 --> 00:55:12,003
you have the militant Millicent here.

664
00:55:12,216 --> 00:55:16,510
She's got her army of caterers
and workmen so you'll be just fine.

665
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:18,962
yeah, I guess.

666
00:55:20,599 --> 00:55:22,058
Well...

667
00:55:22,143 --> 00:55:24,219
...do you care to join me now?

668
00:55:25,771 --> 00:55:28,642
Tempting, tempting...

669
00:55:28,858 --> 00:55:31,313
...but I want to work out
before my meeting.

670
00:55:31,736 --> 00:55:35,899
But I promise you I'll be back
for the party, okay?

671
00:55:48,836 --> 00:55:53,664
Evan Wheeler.
Account number 3-1-6-5-9-3-6.

672
00:55:53,841 --> 00:55:56,842
Look, we've been over this
three times already.

673
00:55:57,345 --> 00:56:00,014
And I realize it's the entire account.

674
00:56:01,432 --> 00:56:04,718
February 16, 1940.

675
00:56:04,936 --> 00:56:07,972
Mother's maiden name? Sather.

676
00:56:08,189 --> 00:56:09,932
Any other questions?

677
00:56:14,862 --> 00:56:16,487
San Francisco.

678
00:56:17,490 --> 00:56:18,818
What's that?

679
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:23,578
Don't tell me where the fuck I was born.
Just transfer the damn funds!

680
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:25,491
Campbell?

681
00:56:26,708 --> 00:56:28,118
Campbell?

682
00:56:32,338 --> 00:56:33,714
yes, Dorothy?

683
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,166
We lost the hot water in the main house.

684
00:56:36,384 --> 00:56:40,049
Could you do me a favor
and relight the pilot in the basement?

685
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:44,340
Sure, that's no problem.

686
00:56:45,184 --> 00:56:47,722
Fucking perfect. Now I'm on the staff.

687
00:57:01,493 --> 00:57:02,903
Perfect.

688
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:35,103
Great.

689
00:57:38,405 --> 00:57:39,733
Damn it!

690
00:57:44,911 --> 00:57:46,489
Fucking perfect.

691
00:58:09,978 --> 00:58:11,971
Shoot.

692
00:58:24,326 --> 00:58:25,820
yeah.

693
00:58:33,418 --> 00:58:35,909
I think that's worth at least a Porsche.

694
00:58:41,009 --> 00:58:42,338
Shit!

695
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,655
There you are. Excuse me.

696
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,540
There you are.

697
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:17,498
-Any luck finding a date tonight?
-I'm playing phone tag with Brian.

698
00:59:17,671 --> 00:59:19,415
-Who?
-Brian.

699
00:59:19,631 --> 00:59:22,301
-Remember the guy from Turbo Dating?
-Right.

700
00:59:22,676 --> 00:59:25,926
-I'm gonna go look around.
-Okay. Have fun.

701
00:59:39,318 --> 00:59:40,978
Still no Campbell?

702
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:42,857
Nope.

703
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,320
Well, it's only...

704
00:59:45,658 --> 00:59:46,986
...1 1 :00.

705
00:59:47,451 --> 00:59:50,238
He said he'd be here before the party.

706
00:59:52,081 --> 00:59:55,616
I'm not an idiot, Kate.
I know when I'm being dumped.

707
00:59:55,835 --> 00:59:58,373
-you're not getting dumped.
-Right.

708
00:59:58,546 --> 01:00:01,665
-Happy Valentine's Day, ladies.
-Hey, Adam.

709
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:06,260
-you look great.
-So do you.

710
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:08,427
yeah, you look great.

711
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:11,308
-Nice party, Dorothy.
-It blows.

712
01:00:12,685 --> 01:00:14,144
Everything okay?

713
01:00:14,270 --> 01:00:18,054
yeah, everything is fine.
It's just that men suck.

714
01:00:18,566 --> 01:00:20,855
That's no offense to you, Adam.

715
01:00:21,527 --> 01:00:22,902
None taken.

716
01:00:27,575 --> 01:00:29,152
Okay. Excuse me.

717
01:00:30,912 --> 01:00:33,319
He'll get here, Dorth. Don't worry.

718
01:00:37,752 --> 01:00:39,210
Don't ask.

719
01:00:42,924 --> 01:00:44,881
Are you doing anything later on?

720
01:00:45,051 --> 01:00:46,878
Actually, I'm busy.

721
01:00:47,053 --> 01:00:50,219
I'm gonna hook up with a young stud.
Get a little action.

722
01:00:50,389 --> 01:00:53,177
Really? Sounds good. Anyone I know?

723
01:00:53,392 --> 01:00:55,681
I'm young, reasonably good-looking.

724
01:00:55,895 --> 01:00:59,264
It shouldn't be that
difficult finding volunteers.

725
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:06,440
yeah, you'll do.

726
01:01:24,591 --> 01:01:25,966
Hey, hot stuff.

727
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:28,458
you came.

728
01:01:30,638 --> 01:01:32,263
I like how you move.

729
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:34,342
Why don't you join me?

730
01:01:46,446 --> 01:01:47,691
you know...

731
01:01:50,074 --> 01:01:52,612
...l'd much rather take you upstairs.

732
01:02:01,628 --> 01:02:03,455
What's upstairs?

733
01:02:04,964 --> 01:02:06,957
Something I want to show you.

734
01:02:07,967 --> 01:02:09,627
It's a surprise.

735
01:02:11,471 --> 01:02:13,796
I love surprises.

736
01:02:36,121 --> 01:02:37,319
So....

737
01:02:37,664 --> 01:02:38,992
So?

738
01:02:42,669 --> 01:02:44,496
We're upstairs now.

739
01:02:44,963 --> 01:02:46,457
yes, we are.

740
01:02:47,924 --> 01:02:49,834
you had a surprise for me?

741
01:02:58,018 --> 01:02:59,678
yes, I do.

742
01:03:13,825 --> 01:03:15,023
Surprise.

743
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:21,666
you brought me up here
to show me your penis.

744
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:25,160
That's so sweet.

745
01:03:30,425 --> 01:03:31,670
Well?

746
01:03:35,514 --> 01:03:37,672
What are you waiting for, honey?

747
01:03:38,058 --> 01:03:39,173
Wax it!

748
01:03:40,853 --> 01:03:43,688
-you're unbelievable.
-Paige.

749
01:03:45,023 --> 01:03:46,518
Relax, okay?

750
01:03:46,859 --> 01:03:48,353
It'll be fun.

751
01:03:52,364 --> 01:03:53,693
All right.

752
01:03:54,533 --> 01:03:56,193
Take off your shirt.

753
01:03:56,744 --> 01:03:58,024
All right.

754
01:04:11,425 --> 01:04:13,216
Don't forget your pants.

755
01:04:23,562 --> 01:04:25,104
Now lay down.

756
01:04:37,493 --> 01:04:38,987
What are you doing?

757
01:04:39,829 --> 01:04:42,236
Never mind. It's a surprise.

758
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:58,972
I knew it.

759
01:04:59,181 --> 01:05:00,462
Knew what?

760
01:05:00,808 --> 01:05:04,259
First time I saw you,
I knew you were kinky, Paige.

761
01:05:11,277 --> 01:05:13,602
you still want me to wax it?

762
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:15,690
yes, I do.

763
01:05:31,506 --> 01:05:34,341
God, Paige! Bitch!

764
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:43,844
This party sucks.

765
01:05:44,018 --> 01:05:46,343
Things didn't go well with Brian?

766
01:05:47,522 --> 01:05:48,850
Oh, my God.

767
01:05:53,653 --> 01:05:56,773
-This is a private party.
-Get your little paws off me.

768
01:05:56,864 --> 01:06:00,648
-What is she doing here?
-She was just leaving, Dorothy.

769
01:06:01,452 --> 01:06:02,781
That's my necklace!

770
01:06:02,954 --> 01:06:05,279
What? Campbell gave this to me.

771
01:06:05,456 --> 01:06:08,208
And what are you supposed to be?
His valentine?

772
01:06:08,418 --> 01:06:11,621
I don't think so, sweetie.
That necklace was stolen!

773
01:06:11,796 --> 01:06:14,583
Along with half the rest of my jewelry.

774
01:06:15,425 --> 01:06:17,382
Hurts, doesn't it?

775
01:06:18,761 --> 01:06:20,386
He loves me.

776
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,382
He loves your trust fund.

777
01:06:25,977 --> 01:06:28,468
-Trust me.
-Time to go.

778
01:06:28,646 --> 01:06:29,891
Watch the jacket!

779
01:06:38,656 --> 01:06:40,982
Now this party officially sucks.

780
01:06:41,159 --> 01:06:42,783
No kidding.

781
01:06:45,121 --> 01:06:46,663
Where are you going?

782
01:06:46,748 --> 01:06:48,123
To chill out.

783
01:06:53,797 --> 01:06:55,339
Hello again.

784
01:06:58,968 --> 01:07:01,756
Wait a minute.
Where are you running off to?

785
01:07:01,971 --> 01:07:03,763
What do you want, Max?

786
01:07:03,848 --> 01:07:05,722
Easy, sweetness.

787
01:07:05,934 --> 01:07:08,259
I wanted to know if you've seen Lily.

788
01:07:08,478 --> 01:07:11,349
She's in L.A.
And don't call me "sweetness."

789
01:07:11,815 --> 01:07:14,388
Well, sweetness, Lily is not in L.A.

790
01:07:15,485 --> 01:07:17,359
What are you talking about?

791
01:07:18,154 --> 01:07:21,358
I called her office,
and they said she never showed up.

792
01:07:22,158 --> 01:07:23,534
Are you sure?

793
01:07:23,702 --> 01:07:24,864
About what?

794
01:07:25,161 --> 01:07:27,534
Hello. Max, about Lily.

795
01:07:28,373 --> 01:07:30,366
How long have you known this?

796
01:07:31,835 --> 01:07:34,871
you're really at home in this outfit, girl.

797
01:07:35,338 --> 01:07:37,876
you just look yum.

798
01:09:09,642 --> 01:09:10,840
Great.

799
01:09:10,935 --> 01:09:12,844
What are you supposed to be?

800
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:24,197
I was just....

801
01:12:39,352 --> 01:12:40,432
Dorothy?

802
01:12:41,772 --> 01:12:44,476
-Are you okay?
-yeah.

803
01:12:44,858 --> 01:12:49,401
Listen. That Max guy said that Lily
never showed up in L.A.

804
01:12:49,613 --> 01:12:51,819
Have you heard anything from her?

805
01:12:52,449 --> 01:12:53,612
No.

806
01:12:55,118 --> 01:12:56,862
But I bet Paige has.

807
01:12:59,289 --> 01:13:00,997
-Do you think he's here?
-Who?

808
01:13:01,208 --> 01:13:03,284
-Jeremy Melton.
-God, I hope not.

809
01:13:03,460 --> 01:13:05,832
My dad's got a gun in his study.

810
01:13:06,046 --> 01:13:08,619
That's a good way to get us both killed.

811
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:15,921
Hello?

812
01:13:16,139 --> 01:13:19,259
It's Detective Vaughn.
We had to let Marquette go.

813
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:20,632
What do you mean?

814
01:13:20,727 --> 01:13:23,135
We didn't have enough evidence
to hold him.

815
01:13:23,355 --> 01:13:25,763
He could be anywhere, like your party.

816
01:13:25,983 --> 01:13:27,975
What? What happened?

817
01:13:28,402 --> 01:13:31,652
Listen, our friend Lily
never showed up in L.A.

818
01:13:31,822 --> 01:13:34,313
Stay put, stay in groups, I'm on my way.

819
01:13:39,413 --> 01:13:41,738
They had to let Marquette go.

820
01:13:41,832 --> 01:13:43,741
So now they've got nothing?

821
01:13:43,834 --> 01:13:45,079
Come on.

822
01:13:55,763 --> 01:13:58,254
Which one of the Twelve Steps is this?

823
01:13:58,349 --> 01:13:59,463
Kate!

824
01:13:59,558 --> 01:14:03,093
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

825
01:14:04,396 --> 01:14:06,638
I wasn't at the bottom of a bottle?

826
01:14:16,742 --> 01:14:17,656
Kate!

827
01:14:19,703 --> 01:14:22,325
Don't be mad! It's Valentine's Day.

828
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:23,992
Get away from me.

829
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,555
Hello?

830
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,934
Hello?

831
01:16:18,406 --> 01:16:21,028
Does someone want to be my valentine?

832
01:16:23,661 --> 01:16:24,906
Come on.

833
01:16:32,837 --> 01:16:34,000
Hello?

834
01:16:38,051 --> 01:16:39,249
Come on.

835
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:45,468
Come on.

836
01:16:51,898 --> 01:16:53,273
Brian?

837
01:16:56,361 --> 01:16:58,567
All right, get the fuck out.

838
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,058
Get off of me!

839
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:38,144
Stop it! Stop!

840
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,725
-Kate!
-yeah?

841
01:18:59,193 --> 01:19:01,020
Shit, we blew a fuse.

842
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,946
Come on. Grab Stephanie. Let's go.

843
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:11,236
Jesus, this place cleared out fast.

844
01:19:11,455 --> 01:19:12,831
Where is Paige?

845
01:19:12,915 --> 01:19:17,542
Probably in the hot tub. She always
ends up in the hot tub at parties.

846
01:19:17,962 --> 01:19:21,212
-Where's Adam?
-Did you check the wine cellar?

847
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:25,926
-Could be him, you know.
-What could be him?

848
01:19:29,932 --> 01:19:34,096
-Come on, Dorothy.
-No, don't "come on, Dorothy" me.

849
01:19:34,437 --> 01:19:36,228
Why the hell not?

850
01:19:36,939 --> 01:19:39,311
Because I know Adam.

851
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:43,642
He's no angel, but he's not a murderer.

852
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:47,570
you didn't know he was an alcoholic
when you first met him either.

853
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,073
I don't know if I trust your judgment.

854
01:19:51,162 --> 01:19:52,739
That's enough!

855
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:56,246
Come on! With a little working out
and some plastic surgery...

856
01:19:56,334 --> 01:19:59,750
...why couldn't Jeremy Melton
become Adam Carr?

857
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:03,754
Then by the same logic,
why couldn't Jeremy Melton be Campbell?

858
01:20:03,841 --> 01:20:04,837
you...

859
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:09,217
...should take that back.

860
01:20:11,182 --> 01:20:13,091
Look, Dorothy.

861
01:20:13,518 --> 01:20:17,895
I'm not saying it's true. I'm saying
if we're gonna be pointing fingers....

862
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:21,100
I mean, you heard
what that Ruthie woman said.

863
01:20:21,192 --> 01:20:23,434
How well do you really know Campbell?

864
01:20:23,611 --> 01:20:27,062
you don't even know his last name,
for God's sake.

865
01:20:29,617 --> 01:20:33,033
-you really can't stand it, can you?
-Can't stand what?

866
01:20:33,121 --> 01:20:36,454
That I found someone just as good
as your boyfriend.

867
01:20:36,541 --> 01:20:40,289
Just as smart and just as good-looking.

868
01:20:40,378 --> 01:20:42,786
-That's ridiculous.
-I mean, why?

869
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:46,664
Why should l, why should the fat girl,
get a turn?

870
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:49,465
-What?
-Come on, Kate!

871
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:52,887
you were always the popular one,
and Shelley was the brainy one...

872
01:20:53,099 --> 01:20:56,848
...Lily was the fun one
and Paige was the sexy one, and I was...

873
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:58,971
...the big, fat one.

874
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:03,722
As far as you're concerned,
that's exactly the way that it is.

875
01:21:03,818 --> 01:21:05,063
you know what?

876
01:21:06,488 --> 01:21:08,646
Screw all of you.

877
01:21:14,662 --> 01:21:16,073
Come back!

878
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:18,327
Come on!

879
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:46,517
Come on, Vaughn.

880
01:22:44,336 --> 01:22:48,203
This is Detective Leon Vaughn, SFPD.
Leave a message.

881
01:23:48,817 --> 01:23:49,897
Hi.

882
01:23:56,283 --> 01:23:57,528
It's you.

883
01:23:59,245 --> 01:24:01,914
-It's me.
-you're still here.

884
01:24:03,290 --> 01:24:04,785
Still here.

885
01:24:05,584 --> 01:24:09,368
I heard a noise.
I thought something happened to Dorothy.

886
01:24:10,965 --> 01:24:13,041
Dorothy's a big girl.

887
01:24:14,927 --> 01:24:16,505
What do you mean?

888
01:24:16,721 --> 01:24:18,547
Dance with me, Kate.

889
01:24:18,848 --> 01:24:22,299
-I just want to find Dorothy.
-I'm asking you nicely.

890
01:24:23,310 --> 01:24:24,805
Dance with me.

891
01:24:32,737 --> 01:24:34,610
Don't make me beg.

892
01:24:35,531 --> 01:24:36,990
Please.

893
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:49,585
I screwed up.

894
01:24:51,964 --> 01:24:54,918
you had a few drinks.
It's not the end of the world.

895
01:24:55,009 --> 01:24:57,298
No, you're disappointed.

896
01:24:59,263 --> 01:25:02,015
I'm just worried that you'll hurt me.

897
01:25:02,433 --> 01:25:03,714
Hurt you?

898
01:25:04,477 --> 01:25:05,936
Hurt you?

899
01:25:06,229 --> 01:25:08,980
No, baby, I love you.

900
01:25:10,566 --> 01:25:13,354
you're the only good thing in my life.

901
01:25:13,778 --> 01:25:17,479
All these other people,
they can just die as far as I care.

902
01:25:18,241 --> 01:25:19,616
But you...

903
01:25:25,164 --> 01:25:27,453
...you mean something to me.

904
01:25:35,174 --> 01:25:37,665
What's the matter? you're shaking.

905
01:25:38,970 --> 01:25:41,426
I don't want to hurt you either, Adam.

906
01:25:41,639 --> 01:25:43,181
I understand.

907
01:25:45,226 --> 01:25:46,389
But I will.

908
01:26:10,835 --> 01:26:12,211
Hello.

909
01:26:20,804 --> 01:26:22,880
What the hell's going on?

910
01:26:22,973 --> 01:26:24,218
Nothing.

911
01:26:26,184 --> 01:26:30,396
What happened back there,
I just want to talk about this.

912
01:26:31,898 --> 01:26:33,476
I'm sorry.

913
01:26:33,733 --> 01:26:36,937
I guess I was just a little upset
about the drinking.

914
01:26:37,028 --> 01:26:38,902
you were doing so well.

915
01:26:59,217 --> 01:27:01,376
Why do you want to hurt me?

916
01:27:02,220 --> 01:27:04,676
I love you. Always loved you.

917
01:27:07,726 --> 01:27:10,264
-Stay away from me!
-Come on.

918
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:57,480
-Adam, I'm sorry.
-It's all right.

919
01:29:58,022 --> 01:29:59,730
I'm so sorry!

920
01:29:59,899 --> 01:30:02,390
All right. It's over.

921
01:30:03,736 --> 01:30:05,065
It's over.

922
01:30:06,406 --> 01:30:08,529
-No, don't look!
-It's all right.

923
01:30:29,095 --> 01:30:30,423
Dorothy!

924
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:49,566
Don't look at her.

925
01:31:08,259 --> 01:31:11,260
It's at the top of the street on the right,
please hurry.

926
01:31:20,355 --> 01:31:22,394
Police are on their way.

927
01:31:23,316 --> 01:31:25,108
I don't understand.

928
01:31:26,111 --> 01:31:28,862
A few weeks ago, she was so happy.

929
01:31:29,197 --> 01:31:31,569
Happier than I'd ever seen her.

930
01:31:33,785 --> 01:31:35,114
It's okay.

931
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:41,116
I just don't understand.

932
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:47,086
All I can think is
when someone is that lonely...

933
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,091
...or that angry...

934
01:31:50,510 --> 01:31:52,836
...they can learn to hide it.

935
01:31:53,138 --> 01:31:55,463
But inside, it never dies.

936
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:57,716
It just stays there.

937
01:31:57,976 --> 01:31:59,720
Eats away at you.

938
01:32:00,479 --> 01:32:03,764
Until one day
you have to do something about it.

939
01:32:04,524 --> 01:32:08,273
But we all liked her. We were her friends.

940
01:32:08,487 --> 01:32:11,238
Sometimes that's not enough, I guess.

941
01:32:15,243 --> 01:32:18,161
I am so sorry for the way I was before.

942
01:32:18,330 --> 01:32:20,406
None of that matters now.

943
01:32:21,667 --> 01:32:23,493
I love you, Adam.

944
01:32:23,835 --> 01:32:25,495
I love you, Kate.

945
01:32:30,342 --> 01:32:32,169
I always have.

946
01:32:35,169 --> 01:32:39,169
