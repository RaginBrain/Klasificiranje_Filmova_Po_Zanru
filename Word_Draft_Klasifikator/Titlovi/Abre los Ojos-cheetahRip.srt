2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Open your eyes.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Open your eyes.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Open your eyes.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Open your eyes.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Open your eyes.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Open your eyes.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Open your eyes.

9
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Open your eyes.

10
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Open your eyes.

11
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why tell me that dream?

12
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You said I could tell you
whatever I wanted.

13
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
All right. Anything else you
should tell me before we start?

14
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Nothing you don't know. I was
about to turn twenty five,...

15
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
...l liked eating, sleeping,
making love, like everyone.

16
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And you know what everyone
does when they get up.

17
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Where are you going?

18
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Out.

19
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Stop leaving messages
on the alarm.

20
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why?

21
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Just don't.

22
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Because it pisses me off.

23
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on, for fuck's sake!

24
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
-I'll slaughter you!
-We'll see about that.

25
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You've got three cars, why do
we always go in this wreck?

26
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

27
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Are you backing out?
l skipped class for this.

28
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm seeing my partners after.
Why do you think I'm dressed up?

29
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So you can shout at them.
You like that.

30
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
l don't shout.

31
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
-So tell me, did you screw her?
-Screw who?

32
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Whoever was there
when I rang last night.

33
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
l was alone last night.
Anyway, what is it to you?

34
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Nothing, you can do what
you want with your life.

35
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Thanks very much.

36
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Let's change the subject.

37
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Did you screw her?

38
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Give me a break,
l was on my own.

39
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So, you did. Was it the one
you talk so much about?

40
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
-Who?
-That Nuria.

41
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
My God, I can't believe it!

42
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
César seeing
the same woman twice!

43
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
-She must be great in bed.
-She isn't bad.

44
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Bastard! When are you going
to tell me the secret?

45
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
-What secret?
-The recipe for Coca-Cola.

46
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
-Look, the kind you like.
-Yeah, change the...

47
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What did you eat today?

48
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Nothing, that's my problem,
I'm starved!

49
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's funny when you ask them
what they value most in a man.

50
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
''l like him to be intelligent,
to be honest, to be kind...''

51
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's all shit!

52
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You'd have problems
lf you were like me.

53
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Not that again!
You aren't ugly.

54
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Anybody would like to have
your face. You're normal.

55
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Normal! That doesn't mean
I'm handsome.

56
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You're handsome.

57
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm acceptable,
when you're not beside me.

58
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're like anorexics.

59
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
They insist they're fat,
and end up crazy.

60
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
When some girl ties you down,
the rest of us will get a chance.

61
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
-Yeah, yeah.
-Why not?

62
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
lf you meet the right girl...

63
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
She doesn't exist.

64
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Shit!

65
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How did I miss that?

66
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
God punished you.

67
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're for lt.

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
-Who are you saying that to?
-To God

69
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Do you believe in God?

70
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't start all that shit.

71
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
l just asked a question.

72
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
lf you don't want to,
don't answer.

73
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
l don't believe in God.

74
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
How do you explain
what happened?

75
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
How do you mean?

76
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Your face.

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
There is no explanation.

78
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
-l believe there is.
-You believe I'm mad.

79
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
l only believe what I see.

80
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You haven't let me see
your face yet.

81
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And I won't.

82
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Do you really think
you're a monster, César?

83
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Come on, let me see.

84
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Stick your hand up your ass!

85
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Take it easy, brat!
I'm sick of all your stories!

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Leave me alone!

87
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'll kick that shit out of you!

88
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Leave me alone!

89
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
l can't work with you in here.
Leave us on our own.

90
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
On my responsibility.

91
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You're just
a spoilt brat, who...

92
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
My parents are dead, asshole!

93
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You made up a story so as
not to admit what you did.

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is that true?

95
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What?

96
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
That you're a spoilt brat.

97
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
My father had a restaurant
chain. That's not my fault.

98
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
When did your parents die?

99
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
-15 years ago,...

100
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
...in an accident.

101
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
-And now you're rich.
-So they say.

102
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Then why don't
you want a lawyer?

103
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
They say they can get me
the best.

104
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But they want me
stuck here forever.

105
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Who are they?

106
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
My partners. They've been suckling
my blood since I was a kid.

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Now they've got everything.
They've cut me out.

108
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It wasn't them.
It was me.

109
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
l don't care.

110
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's see, César.
Do you know why you're here?

111
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
-Because I wear a mask, I guess.
-No.

112
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Because you killed someone.

113
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Or don't you remember?

114
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Tell me, don't you remember?

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Fuck, stop it!

116
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
We must get things clear
lf you want us to get on.

117
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
l don't want us to get on!

118
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Is your solution to sit
in this hole and not talk?

119
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
-Aren't we talking now?
-After two months.

120
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've been trying
for two months.

121
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
-Read the reports.
-I've read them.

122
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
l want you to tell me,
lf possible, slitting on a char.

123
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Or are you going to stay there?

124
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
l like the floor.

125
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's the only thing
that seems real.

126
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What does everything else seem?

127
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Everything else is a lie.

128
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
All this seems a lie.

129
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Including you.

130
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You don't even wear
a white coat.

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you think I should?

132
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Doctors wear them.

133
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
l took it off so you'd forget
l was a doctor.

134
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So that you'd like me more.

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It didn't work.
l hate the sight of you.

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Now that we're friends,...

137
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
-I've got no friends.
-...tell me what happened.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The sooner you talk,
the sooner I'll go.

139
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hey! Happy birthday and all
the things people usually say.

140
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Thank you, thank you.

141
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
-Where did you find her?
-In the library.

142
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
-She tried to steal my book.
-It was mine.

143
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Anyway...

144
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
-César, Sofía.
-Hello.

145
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Happy birthday.

146
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
-Thank you.
-Your present.

147
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
-Thanks a lot.
-We bought it between us.

148
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Then I have to thank
both of you.

149
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Stop chatting her up
and open lt.

150
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
-I'd rather open them tomorrow.
-Whatever.

151
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
-Like a drink?
-Sure.

152
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll leave this upstairs.

153
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Hello.

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What are you doling here?

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
-Happy birthday, darling.
-Thank you.

156
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But I didn't ask you
to the party.

157
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
That was nice of you.

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
l brought you a present too.

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Why not open it?

160
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
No, thanks. I already know
what's inside.

161
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
-And last night?
-Listen, Nuria.

162
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
l don't like you just turning up,
much less coming into my room.

163
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
-Well! Do I have to apologize?
-No.

164
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You have to go.

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Right, I know what it is.

166
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You don't want to be seen twice
with the same girl.

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It would run your reputation.

168
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You got it in one.

169
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
And there's someone else.

170
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
-Right.
-Who?

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The brunette you were
talking to a minute ago?

172
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Well, she's not bad.

173
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
l don't care.

174
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
l don't need to be seen
with you.

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Hold me.

176
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Come on.

177
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
A little kiss.

178
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Come on.

179
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Until when?

180
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Until next Friday?

181
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Can you manage
a weekend without me?

182
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Excuse me, I must see
to my guests.

183
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes, the brunette will take time.
She looks that type.

184
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
-That type?
-Yes.

185
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The kind who can't find
your zipper.

186
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Hello.

187
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hello.

188
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
What did you want?

189
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
-To open this.
-Walt.

190
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'll serve you.

191
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Since when are you the waiter?

192
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Don't you know
I'm in catering?

193
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Are you all right?

194
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Can you tell
I'm elbowing in?

195
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
A bit.

196
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I've got a slight problem.
A girl's chasing me.

197
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You don't say.

198
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
l need some help
to get rid of her.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
And I'm that help.

200
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
-Shit, there she is!
-Where?

201
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't look, don't look.
Look over here.

202
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
That's lt.

203
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes.

204
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Yes, yes, yes.

205
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Here we are.

206
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Here we are.

207
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Well...

208
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Act as if we were talking about
something real interesting.

209
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Nod your head, agree,
say yes.

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You know.

211
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
-What a nice conversation.
-Yes.

212
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And she's coming this way.

213
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Fuck!

214
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
-What are you doing?
-Don't worry, I'll guide you.

215
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
-Straight on.
-l don't see her.

216
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Here it is.

217
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Go right in.

218
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm not going in there.

219
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Well, I am. So long.

220
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
-He's in here.
-You...!

221
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Well...

222
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
We're safe.

223
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But we've got nothing
to drink here.

224
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
l think all you really want
is to chat me up.

225
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yes, that too.

226
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
First, I want to save my skin.

227
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Can't you say
you aren't interested?

228
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
She wouldn't care.

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
She never gets tired.

230
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
-She must be feeling bad.
-Yeah.

231
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Of course.

232
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
So you're studying Drama,
like Pelayo?

233
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
For now.

234
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Scenography?

235
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
-Acting.
-Really?

236
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
To be an actress?

237
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
l am an actress.
Is that a problem?

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes.

239
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Aren't you ashamed?

240
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Ashamed? Why should
l be ashamed?

241
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Actors aren't honest.

242
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You're able to show
emotions you don't have,...

243
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
...or which, at most,
you invent.

244
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Right now, you could
be thinking,...

245
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
...''This guy's a real drag.
How can I dump him?''

246
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
-Really?
-''And in catering.''

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
''A pain in the ass.''

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
But you're a good actress,
it doesn't show.

249
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hey, Pelayo!

250
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
l caught you.

251
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Come in.

252
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
How's it going?

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Great. I'm a bit out of it now.

254
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Drunk, you mean.

255
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Why are you in here?

256
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Sofía was protecting me from
a female psychopath out there.

257
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
She seemed dangerous.

258
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Yeah.

259
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What about you?

260
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
l was drinking.
Women don't chase after me.

261
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
We're out of drink.

262
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Here.

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
-Shit.
-I'll get some more.

264
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
For all of us.

265
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Well...

266
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
l guess I'll be going.

267
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
But why?

268
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I've drunk too much
and I don't feel well.

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't be stupid,
It's just starting.

270
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
-For you, it is.
-Pelayo.

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You can't go.
You're my guest of honor.

272
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
You're a son of a bitch, César.

273
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
-Why d'you say that?
-The party's full of girls.

274
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
l go for a piss, you start
talking to her, and...

275
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What?

276
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Nothing. And I look like
an asshole.

277
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Tell me what's wrong.

278
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Why do you have
to chat up Sofía?

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No one's chatting up Sofía.

280
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Yeah, and I'm blind, right?

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're certainly drunk.

282
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm drunk,
but I'll tell you this.

283
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
l like Sofía.
A hell of a lot.

284
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
She may even be
the girl of my dreams.

285
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But if she fucks up our
friendship, she can go to hell.

286
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
l feel the same.

287
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Sure.

288
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Pelayo, where are you going?

289
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
-Home.
-Already?

290
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah, I'm wrecked.

291
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
-I'll come with you.
-Don't bother.

292
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
-You stay.
-Are you going too?

293
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
l have to get up early.

294
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
l can run you home later.

295
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Stay on, I'm leaving you
in good hands.

296
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What's wrong with him?

297
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
He's drunk.

298
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
-Is he annoyed with us?
-No.

299
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You sure?

300
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
She doesn't look too happy.

301
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Didn't you have to get up early?

302
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm doing too much
for you tonight.

303
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
-Maybe it means something.
-Yeah, that you've got a nerve.

304
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's just for a minute.

305
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Long enough for my friend
Nuria to admit defeat.

306
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
This is my place.

307
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't dare laugh at lt.

308
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Why would I laugh?

309
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's nothing special,
but it's cheap.

310
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
-Do you like clowns?
-They're not clowns.

311
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
They're mime artists.

312
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Pancho!

313
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
-I've got a cat.
-l hate cats.

314
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
They're almost as false
as actresses.

315
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Says the caterer.

316
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
How do you pay for this?

317
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Do your parents help?

318
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Do you work?

319
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
He's real nosy,
Isn't he, Pancho?

320
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I'm an arms dealer.

321
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Fancy that! I always wanted to
know how arms dealers lived.

322
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Now you do.

323
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
How can I explain it to you?

324
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
You wouldn't understand.

325
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Even I don't understand.

326
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
She was making coffee and
l started snooping around.

327
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Suddenly, I got that stupid feeling
a lot of people get.

328
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Well, I like lt.

329
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
-What dld you feel?
-That I loved her.

330
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
God, I'm even embarrassed
to say lt.

331
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
l didn't hear you.

332
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
l said I like your place.

333
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
And I like yours.

334
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Let's swap.

335
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You wouldn't like it
tomorrow morning.

336
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
l said it because of the decor.

337
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Your place is more...

338
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
More personal.

339
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
And warmer.

340
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Warmer?

341
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
-Yes.
-You think my house is cold?

342
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
A bit.

343
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
-And am l?
-l don't know.

344
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You said my house
seemed cold.

345
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
lf you're waiting for me
to list your virtues, hard luck.

346
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You think you're real smart.

347
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
-Maybe.
-Well, you're wrong.

348
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
l don't need you
to list my virtues.

349
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
No, I'm sure you know
what they are.

350
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But you'd like me
to see them too.

351
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
So you say.

352
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm not going
to argue about lt.

353
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Just as well.

354
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You'd lose.

355
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh, yeah?

356
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,000
But I don't want to argue either.
l propose we do the opposite.

357
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
We don't argue?

358
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
We show our defects.

359
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Great!

360
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
l hope you're being fair.

361
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This is absolutely you.

362
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Well, mine is finished.

363
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Fuck!

364
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
That's how you see me?

365
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Did I go too far?

366
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Sign lt.

367
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Let's see mine.

368
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
It's lovely!

369
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It's not a caricature.

370
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You see.

371
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You draw beautifully.

372
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
-I'll sell it to you.
-Miser.

373
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
-How much?
-As it's you,....

374
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
...I'll settle for...

375
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,000
...a kiss.

376
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That smile is going to kill me!

377
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It would be wrong
lf we did anything tonight.

378
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
-Why?
-Pelayo. Remember?

379
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Your best friend.

380
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
He doesn't have to find out.
Besides, he'd do the same.

381
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
l see friendship
really matters to you.

382
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It does.

383
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
That's why I wouldn't tell him.

384
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Some people...

385
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
...say that they would be
happy with a normal life span.

386
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
But ''normal'' means different
things, depending on...

387
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
What are you looking at?

388
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm watching TV.

389
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
l...the Romans, for instance,
llvedonly25years.

390
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Today,...

391
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
...that figure has tripled,
which means that...

392
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
What the fuck is he on about?

393
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
l saw this before.

394
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's about cryonlzatlon.

395
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Cryo-what?

396
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
When they freeze you
or something.

397
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Like Walt Disney.

398
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Wow, that's cold!

399
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Hey, you!

400
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
There won't be a landslide.

401
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It isn't dangerous, the ground
is firm here, and very solid.

402
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Are you leaving?

403
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Going home.
Here's my number.

404
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But I'll call tomorrow.

405
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
What for?

406
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
All right, I won't call.

407
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
César.

408
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What is it?

409
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Come here.
l want to tell you a secret.

410
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Come here.

411
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Hello, darling.

412
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Did you follow me?

413
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Of course...

414
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
...l didn't.

415
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
But I had the feeling
we'd meet.

416
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
-How was the brunette?
-Great.

417
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Why?

418
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
From your face, I'd say
you didn't sleep with her.

419
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Let me guess.

420
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
You didn't sleep with her,
but you don't mind.

421
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
You have all the time
in the world...

422
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
...for that.

423
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
And I bet you're
seeing her tomorrow.

424
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
-Brilliant.
-Aren't l?

425
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
There's more.

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
-Well?
-l scored at the party too.

427
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
But he wasn't up to lt.
So I'm still hot for lt.

428
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
-And?
-And until you meet up again...

429
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
...with your Miss Universe,
you could have fun.

430
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
No, I think I prefer
to go home and sleep.

431
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Come on, César.

432
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
It's your birthday.

433
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
-Skip it, I'm going home.
-What's up, César?

434
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Are you scared?

435
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Want some of this?

436
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No, thanks.

437
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Sure, act the innocent now.

438
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
l don't need that
to enjoy myself.

439
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
l can see that.

440
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That's not a good idea.

441
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Do what you want.

442
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
What's happiness for you?

443
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
-What?
-For me, this is happiness.

444
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Being here with you.
What about you?

445
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
l can't handle heavy
conversations right now.

446
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Your thoughts are
somewhere else, right?

447
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Maybe.

448
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
One thing really bothers me.

449
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
-What?
-You know nothing about me.

450
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Except my name's Nuria
and I'm a good fuck.

451
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Two important things.

452
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You don't know my address
or my number.

453
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
We have to start somewhere.
I'm going to see your house now.

454
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
It's not far.

455
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Tell me something.

456
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Do you believe in God?

457
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

458
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
-How are you?
-You got home all right?

459
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Yeah. Well, I had
a horrible dream.

460
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That you never saw me again.

461
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Yes! I come out of your
house, go to my car,...

462
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
...and that crazy bitch
has been following me.

463
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
-Who, that Nuria?
-Yes.

464
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
She comes over and says,
''Want a lift?''

465
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
She goes on so much
l don't know how to say no.

466
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
So I get in the car,
she drives faster and faster,...

467
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
...and kills herself.

468
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
-With me inside.
-That's horrible.

469
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But the worst part...

470
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
...is that my face
is completely destroyed,...

471
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
...like ''The Phantom
of the Opera''.

472
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
l couldn't wake up.

473
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
l was a monster.

474
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
You're a monster anyway.

475
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

476
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm a monster too.

477
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Look.

478
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
How was your house?

479
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Was anyone left?

480
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Left where?

481
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
In your house.

482
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
There was a party, remember?

483
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
A party?

484
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Dreaming is shit.

485
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
That dream was nice.

486
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
A park, children playing,
a girl who loves you.

487
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
That's why.

488
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Then you wake up
and you want to die.

489
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:46,000
At first, I didn't even have
the strength to react.

490
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'd been in a coma
for three weeks.

491
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You were lucky.

492
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
You could have died,
like Nuria.

493
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
What if I had?

494
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
It would've been better.

495
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Did you see her body?

496
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
-l never did.
-You think she didn't die?

497
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm like you.

498
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
l only believe what I see.

499
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
César, show me
your face, please.

500
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
-What for?
-Look.

501
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,000
It's true you had an accident.
It's true...

502
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
...you were disfigured, but
not any more. Take that off.

503
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
The doctors fixed you.

504
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
They didn't have
a fucking clue!

505
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
In the accident you didn't lose
just skin and some muscle.

506
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
The blow was so severe it caused
a multiple fracture of the skull.

507
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We secured the osseous
structure with metal wires,...

508
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
...and, over that,
we reinserted the muscles...

509
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
...we could still retrieve.

510
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Yes, very nice,
but I know all that.

511
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I've had it explained
to me 150 times.

512
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
But you never say
when you'll operate.

513
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:47,000
-I've been waiting two months.
-But we've operated three times.

514
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
l wouldn't call that
an operation. I'd call it...

515
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Well...

516
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
l don't know what I'd call lt.

517
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
The symmetry isn't perfect,...

518
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
...but what we've done with
your face is, if I may say so...

519
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
...a craftsman's job..

520
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
We can't work on skin
which is pure scars.

521
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
No, no, there must be some way.

522
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
-What?
-''What?''

523
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You're the doctors, aren't you?

524
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
A transplant, whatever!

525
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
There's a problem with fibrosis.
lf we operate again,...

526
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
...we may just cause
further damage.

527
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
We'd need millimetric
precision,...

528
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
...and today,
that's impossible

529
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Let's look at this.
I'm not an idiot.

530
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Today, people change
their breasts.

531
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,000
They have hair implants.

532
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
They even change
their skin color.

533
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Are you saying that on the
threshold of the year 2,000...

534
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,000
...you can't do a simple operation
and sort out this...

535
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
...this fuck-up?

536
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
It isn't so simple, César.
Remember...

537
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Don't patronize me!

538
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Stop treating me like a child!

539
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I'm not just any patient.

540
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
And this isn't
a welfare hospital.

541
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I'm willing to pay any amount.

542
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You're in charge.

543
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
They say you're the best
in your field.

544
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Well, invent something,
experiment on me.

545
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
I've seen patients who've
lost all their features,...

546
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
...who can't even talk.

547
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
At least, you can look
yourself in the eye.

548
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
What good is that?

549
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Every time I look in the mirror
l want to die.

550
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Your case isn't so serious.

551
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Just learn to accept lt.

552
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
And who'll accept me?

553
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Will you explain to the people
who look at me in the street?

554
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Will you tell them
that looks aren't important?

555
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
That beauty is on the inside?

556
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
We'd like to show you something.

557
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
What is this?

558
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
A facial prosthesis.

559
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
We use it in extreme cases
of rejection, like yours.

560
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
This is shit!

561
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
It's not the best solution.

562
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
But It's all we can do
for the moment.

563
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
l want a face!

564
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Not a mask!

565
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
We don't work miracles.

566
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
That's what the bastard said.

567
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
But in the end, they did.

568
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Did what?

569
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Work a miracle.

570
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
So it seems.

571
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
So it seems?
Things are or they aren't.

572
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
-Did they do it or not?
-I'm tired. Why don't you go?

573
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I'll be back on Tuesday.
Want anything?

574
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,000
-No.
-All right.

575
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
See you on Tuesday.

576
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
A pad and a pencil.

577
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
But don't tell them. I don't
want to owe them anything.

578
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Have I changed so much?

579
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Because I recognize you.

580
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
How are you?

581
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,000
''How are you?''

582
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
You're playing a part now,
but I don't know what.

583
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Your lips are smiling,...

584
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
-...but your eyes are trembling.
-What?

585
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
You're really very good.

586
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
As an actress.

587
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
l asked how you were.
You needn't answer.

588
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm alive.

589
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
How should I be?

590
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And I'm tired.

591
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Tired of waiting
for you to call,...

592
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
...even to say,
''Tough luck''.

593
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
l was busy.

594
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Bullshit!

595
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,000
l was afraid you'd feel
uncomfortable if I rang.

596
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You were afraid
you'd feel uncomfortable.

597
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Afraid you couldn't
look me in the face.

598
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Like now.

599
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That's not true.

600
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I've often dreamed
of this moment.

601
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
What moment?

602
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
The moment we'd meet again.

603
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
In my dream we were
just like this.

604
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Here,...

605
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,000
...In the park.

606
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Although,...

607
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
...something was different.

608
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,000
What?

609
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
It wasn't raining.

610
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
l have to go, César.

611
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
What are you doing
tomorrow night?

612
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,000
-Studying. I'm very busy.
-It's Friday, we could meet.

613
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I've got a lot to do.

614
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
All right, so long.

615
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
César!

616
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
We'll meet if you want.

617
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
lf you want.

618
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,000
As soon as there is the
slightest possibility of death,...

619
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
...the stabilization and transport
team goes into action.

620
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Once the client is declared
legally dead,...

621
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
...he is put into
a maintenance capsule...

622
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,000
...and the transport legalities
are sorted out.

623
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
In the storeroom in Arizona,
in the U.S.A.,...

624
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
...a team of specialists prepare
the body for final freezing.

625
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Among other measures,...

626
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
...blood is replaced by a solution
which conserves the organs.

627
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Finally,...

628
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
...the client is put
in the capsule...

629
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
...where he will remain until
medicine can reanimate him.

630
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
To be honest,
I'd have to think it over.

631
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
It's hard to accept the idea.

632
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
How should we view it?

633
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
We are, undoubtedly,...

634
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
...facing a major development,...

635
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
...a new challenge
for humanity.

636
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,000
It's understandable that
the first reaction is rejection.

637
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
We have now got
the means to do lt.

638
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
We've got the technology.

639
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
But, above all,...

640
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
...we have sufficient
moral maturity...

641
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,000
...to understand what
this new step means...

642
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
...for human evolution,
to look at the future...

643
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
...and put an end to certain
meaningless taboos,...

644
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
...inherited from
ancient religions,...

645
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
...old and useless memories.

646
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Thank you for speaking to us.

647
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
And thank you
to our audience...

648
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
-Hl.
-Hl.

649
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
What's that?

650
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Shit, isn't it?

651
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
But they suggested I wear it,
in case of infection.

652
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Well, kid.

653
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,000
What're you up to?

654
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Arguing with doctors all day.

655
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
-You should go out more.
-I'm trying.

656
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
What're you having?

657
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
-Rum and coke, you want one?
-Yes.

658
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,000
I'll get you one.

659
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm going to the bathroom.

660
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Take that off.

661
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Why?

662
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Don't you realize you won't
be able to hide your face?

663
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
l told you,
It's to stop infections.

664
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Sure.

665
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
lf you're embarrassed, just go.
Nobody asked you to come.

666
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Sofia did.

667
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,000
What?

668
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
She didn't want to be alone
with you.

669
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Why not?

670
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
You're giving her a hard time.

671
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm having a hard time.

672
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Talk to a psychologist,
or to me.

673
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Don't take it out on a girl
you met once.

674
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Did she say that?

675
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Did she say that?

676
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Bitch!

677
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Come back!

678
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Whiskey and Coke.

679
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
What whiskey?

680
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
What did you say?

681
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
What whiskey?

682
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Why don't you ask me
to my face, son of a bitch?

683
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Ballantine's.

684
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Same again.

685
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:42,000
No, this one's on me.

686
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Why?

687
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Just is.

688
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Fix your face, man!

689
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

690
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Where were you?

691
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Around.

692
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Pelayo went to look for you.

693
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
And I came to look for you.

694
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Why?

695
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
To...

696
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
No reason.

697
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
To...

698
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
...buy you a drink.

699
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
-Want a drink?
-No, thanks.

700
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Can you tell I'm elbowing in?

701
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,000
The thing is,...

702
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
...I've got a problem.

703
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
A girl's chasing me,...

704
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,000
...and I need some help
to get rid of her.

705
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Shit, shit, shit,
she's coming this way.

706
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
She's coming this way.

707
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Don't look, don't look.

708
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
You carry on talking,
act as if he weren't here.

709
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
l mean, as if I were here.

710
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Keep talking,
tra-la-lee, tra-la-la.

711
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
What a lovely conversation
we're having.

712
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
So that's it, here we are.

713
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Having a bit of a chat
about life.

714
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,000
That's enough!

715
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Where the hell were you?

716
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Around.

717
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I'm leaving, I'm tired.

718
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
You two stay if you want.

719
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Well, this is where
l leave you.

720
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
-I'll see you home.
-No, I live very close.

721
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
-I've got the motor bike.
-No.

722
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Don't be silly!

723
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Lay off, Pelayo.
She wants to go on her own.

724
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Shut up, you're drunk.

725
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
l might be drunk,
but I'm not an idiot.

726
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
-Anyway, I'm not drunk.
-Really, you needn't bother.

727
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
As you wish.

728
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
You're the one who's drunk.

729
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
We'll call you to meet
some other day.

730
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
All right, we could go
to the moles.

731
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,000
-You hear?
-Great!

732
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Well, that's it, then.

733
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
No, don't kiss me.

734
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
You might get poisoned
by my drunken breath.

735
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Well...

736
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
We'll meet up soon.

737
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Sure.

738
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
We'll meet up soon.

739
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,000
It's not cold.

740
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Well...

741
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I'm gonna have to go.

742
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Where are you going?

743
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I've just remembered
my bike is back here.

744
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I'll go with you.

745
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
No, why?
You're almost home now.

746
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
-See you tomorrow.
-Pelayo.

747
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Walt a minute.

748
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,000
What?

749
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,000
l don't know.

750
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
You drank too much.
We'll talk tomorrow if you want.

751
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Tomorrow, I'll wish
l were dead.

752
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,000
You won't.

753
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You just need to rest.

754
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Pelayo!

755
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
You're my best friend.

756
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Son of a bitch!

757
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Open your eyes.

758
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
César.

759
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:42,000
It's me.

760
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Sofía!

761
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
-What are you doing here?
-Forgive me.

762
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Why?

763
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
l love you.

764
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Come on.

765
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
What's wrong?

766
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
Nothing.

767
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
l still can't believe
this is really happening.

768
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Where's Pelayo?

769
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
l don't know. He went
with you, didn't he?

770
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Yes.

771
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Of course.

772
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Come on.

773
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
God, what a sensation!

774
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Of what?

775
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Do you ever feel you've
lived something before?

776
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Yes.

777
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Why is that?

778
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
They say it's a lapse
in the bran.

779
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I've been here before.

780
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,000
It usually goes away
after a few seconds.

781
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,000
l don't want it to go away.

782
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,000
You've made use of your time.

783
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
That's all there is here.

784
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Very pretty.

785
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Is it Sofía?

786
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:11,000
How much longer will I be here?

787
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,000
No one ever knows that.

788
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Even my worst nightmare
was never like this place.

789
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,000
It's a psychiatric penitentiary.
No more, no less.

790
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
l shouldn't be here.

791
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You're accused of murder.

792
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
l don't even know what I did.

793
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Tell me something.

794
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Does the name Ally
mean anything to you?

795
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,000
All...

796
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
You know a girl
with that name?

797
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,000
No.

798
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Why do you ask?

799
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
It seems you kept
repeating it last night.

800
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
l guess I was dreaming.

801
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
What did you dream?

802
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:49,000
l can't remember.

803
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
It could be important.

804
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
How could it be important?

805
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Look, I can prove you didn't
know what you were doing,...

806
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
...but first I have to find
some explanation for all this.

807
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,000
There is no explanation.
l told you the other day.

808
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
What did you dream, César?

809
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
l don't know.

810
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
l only remember bits.

811
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
First, I'm in a kind of office.

812
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,000
A secretary shows me
into another office.

813
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
There, there's a photo
of a sunset and a man.

814
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,000
Then...

815
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
l don't know.

816
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
-They show me lots of papers.
-What papers?

817
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,000
l don't know.

818
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,000
But I sign them.

819
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
Does the office belong
to your company?

820
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
No, I don't recognize lt.

821
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,000
You dreamed of a place
you'd never been?

822
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Yes. That happens a lot,
doesn't it?

823
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Are they the papers...

824
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,000
...you signed with the doctors?

825
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
No, what happened with
the doctors was surreal.

826
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
-Why?
-One day they rang me...

827
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
...to go to the hospital.

828
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
When I arrived, the whole
surgical team was waiting.

829
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,000
For months,...

830
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
...those faces had looked
at me with indifference...

831
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
...and impotence.

832
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Now they were all smiles.

833
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,000
The same bastard who had
said my case was hopeless...

834
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
...started talking about
some operation.

835
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
They had a new revolutionary
system in the clinic now.

836
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
They said that
within two weeks...

837
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
...my face would be
completely reconstructed.

838
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
You didn't believe them?

839
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
No, not at first.

840
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,000
l thought it was just a way
to get more money out of me.

841
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,000
But they showed me all
the gadgets for the operation.

842
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
It looked like science fiction.

843
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
All I could see were cables,
switches, monitors.

844
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Actually, I never really knew
what they were going to do.

845
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
But I thought
I'd nothing to lose.

846
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Those people were
used to rhino plastics,...

847
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
...liposuctions,
hair transplants,...

848
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,000
...but my operation
was much more.

849
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,000
In less than a week,...

850
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
...my life had turned around.

851
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
One night, I was lying
on the ground, drunk,...

852
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:04,000
...wanting to die.

853
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
The next morning, my dreams
were coming true,...

854
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
...like in the movies.

855
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Sofía loved me, and the doctors
found the miracle cure.

856
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,000
l don't know.
Obviously, I was suspicious.

857
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,000
Suspicious?

858
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Of whom? Of what?

859
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
l don't know.

860
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
In life, you never know.

861
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Happiness comes
when you least expect lt.

862
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
l once knew a guy
who was alone in the world.

863
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Suddenly, he was
married with two daughters.

864
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Fuck, you've got a strange
idea of happiness.

865
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Well, that depends
on the individual.

866
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What's happiness for you?

867
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,000
What's happiness for you?

868
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Don't ask any more stupid
questions.

869
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
But at that time you were happy.
Or weren't you?

870
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So what?
My life now is shit.

871
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
All I can do is eat,
shit, sleep,...

872
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
...and dream of my memories.

873
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,000
It's good that you remember.

874
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Well?

875
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Well, what?

876
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,000
They were to remove
the plates today.

877
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
And they did.

878
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And?

879
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Well, my ears are
where they should be.

880
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
César, don't scare me.

881
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
Take off the plates.

882
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
You do lt.

883
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
How did they do it?

884
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Walt.

885
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Just to say...

886
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
...that I love you.

887
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,000
You're going too fast,...

888
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
...considering
we met yesterday.

889
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Yesterday?

890
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
My birthday,
don't you remember?

891
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
l met an incredible girl.

892
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Her name was Sofía.

893
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
But today I woke up
feeling great,...

894
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,000
...and now I'm with
the girl again.

895
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
What is it?

896
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
What is it?

897
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
lf you want me to move,
you have to put in a coin.

898
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Ting!

899
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:43,000
We never appreciate the good
moments till they're over.

900
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,000
Maybe that's why
they're good moments.

901
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
We don't stop to think
about them.

902
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Perhaps.

903
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,000
What happened to Pelayo?

904
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,000
-What's up?
-Hang on a minute.

905
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,000
-That's lt.
-About time.

906
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
-Want anything else?
-No, thanks.

907
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
How's things, Pelayo?

908
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Fine.

909
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
How's things, Pelayo?

910
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Fine.

911
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,000
Yeah.

912
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I'm actually not as fucked up
as I look.

913
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I'm used to you always
winning, you bastard.

914
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
And Sofía isn't that great.

915
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
You said she was ideal.

916
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Really?

917
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,000
l was drunk.

918
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Anyway, we're friends.

919
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Bastard!

920
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
What's that on your face?

921
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
What?

922
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Fuck, there's a seam opening!

923
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
What are you on about?

924
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
You fucking idiot!

925
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
What's the matter?

926
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
l hate dreaming.

927
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000
You're tickling me.

928
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,000
What's wrong?

929
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:28,000
What is it?

930
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
-Where's Sofía?
-What?

931
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
What have you done with Sofía?

932
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,000
-l am Sofía.
-You bitch!

933
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
You're mad.

934
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:47,000
-You're mad.
-Where is she?

935
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,000
In one minute,
I'm going to call the police.

936
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
You'll be in trouble
lf Sofía doesn't appear.

937
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
So you survived the accident.

938
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:17,000
What accident?

939
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Whose body was it?

940
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
-l didn't have an accident.
-No.

941
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
It wasn't an accident.
It was attempted murder.

942
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
A pity you didn't see
my face, bitch!

943
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Why are you doing this?
How have I changed?

944
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:30,000
You haven't.

945
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
You're the same lunatic
who gate crashed my party.

946
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I'm the girl you made love to
just now. I'm Sofía.

947
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Stop saying you're Sofía,
do you hear?

948
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Don't say her name!

949
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
You won't tell me
where she is.

950
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
You never will.

951
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
César...

952
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
l love you.

953
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
-Hello.
-Hello.

954
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
You can go, I'll see to this.

955
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Right.

956
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Let me get this clear.

957
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Where were you last night?

958
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
At home.
l told that gentleman.

959
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
At home. With whom?

960
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
With a girl.

961
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The girl I just questioned?

962
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
No, that's another girl.
l was with Sofía.

963
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
The girl I spoke to was Sofía.

964
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
Yes, that's what she says,
but it's a lie.

965
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Who is she then?

966
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
-She's... Nuria.
-Nuria?

967
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:43,000
Nuria what?

968
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
l don't know. She never
told me her surname.

969
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Let's see.

970
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:54,000
You were at home with a girl
called Sofía, and suddenly...

971
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
l go to the bathroom, come back,
and she's in Sofia's place.

972
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Where's Sofía?

973
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Ask Nuria, she's pretending
to be her.

974
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
You don't know her surname?

975
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
But who do you believe,
her or me?

976
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Listen, that girl's papers
are all in order.

977
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,000
We've let her go.

978
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:13,000
You've what?

979
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
And I assure you
she's called Sofía.

980
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Sofía Cueto, and she lives
at number 2, Qulrós St.

981
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
No!

982
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
No, what?

983
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Well, yes, but that's
another girl.

984
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
l know the real Sofía.

985
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Then tell me where she is.

986
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Because, legally,...

987
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
...the girl
you're talking about...

988
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:34,000
...only exists
in your imagination.

989
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
-l don't believe this.
-And another thing,...

990
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,000
...the girl looks
as if she'd been hit.

991
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
She was in my house,
supplanting my girlfriend!

992
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,000
l don't know why,...

993
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,000
...but she wouldn't
press charges.

994
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Fucking great!
So now she's the victim!

995
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Tell me.

996
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Are you on drugs?

997
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
-God!
-We do know...

998
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
...you were under
psychiatric care.

999
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,000
My face was destroyed
in a car crash she caused!

1000
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Your face looks fine.

1001
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Because...

1002
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
It doesn't matter. I've
got nothing more to say.

1003
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,000
Young man...

1004
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I'd advise you to see
a psychiatrist.

1005
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Are you an idiot?

1006
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:24,000
What the fuck is this?

1007
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
-What do you mean?
-lf you wanted...

1008
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
...to fuck her up,
there are other ways to do it!

1009
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Keep away from Sofía!

1010
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
it isn't Sofía, it's Nuria!

1011
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Nuria's dead!

1012
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Calm down, or you'll be
sleeping in a cell tonight!

1013
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Don't ever talk to me again!

1014
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,000
l don't know what the cops
told you, but Nuria is alive!

1015
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
The cops didn't tell me,
Sofía did.

1016
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Listen, you spoke to her
by phone, didn't you?

1017
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,000
-Let go!
-It wasn't Sofía.

1018
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Nuria can imitate her voice,
she took her ID, her apartment.

1019
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
It wasn't over the phone.
I've just dropped her home.

1020
01:11:58,000 --> 01:11:59,000
She looked like this.

1021
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Nice photo, isn't it?

1022
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
You going to say
that isn't Sofía?

1023
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
But that's...

1024
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
Is this a joke or what?

1025
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
You're crazy, man.

1026
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm crazy?

1027
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
I'm crazy?

1028
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:25,000
You're the ones who are mad!
You're all mad!

1029
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Let go of me!

1030
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
God, what's happening?

1031
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,000
It's my partners, right?

1032
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
They've paid you,
this is a plot!

1033
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Look at yourself. You haven't
been right since the accident.

1034
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
Fuck you!

1035
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:45,000
Are you saying...

1036
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Are you saying this is the girl
you ran after the other night?

1037
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
-Is this your ideal girl?
-Yes!

1038
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
And you took her.

1039
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
You need a psychiatrist!

1040
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:12,000
Problems?

1041
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:15,000
I'm in no mood, so just...

1042
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
There's an explanation
for all this.

1043
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
César.

1044
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
Who are you?

1045
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
-You've seen me on TV.
-What do you want?

1046
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm here to help you.

1047
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,000
First of all, it's very important
that you calm down.

1048
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
-Calm down?
-You must overcome your fears...

1049
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
...and regal control.

1050
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
What control do you mean?
I'm fine.

1051
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Who says you aren't?

1052
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,000
They do. All of them.

1053
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
They say I'm mad.

1054
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
No, of course you're not mad.

1055
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:52,000
But what if I told you...

1056
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
...you were dreaming?

1057
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
No, no, no...

1058
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
-Why not?
-Look,...

1059
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
...l know what's real,
and this is real.

1060
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
How do you know?

1061
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
You discover your dreams
when you wake.

1062
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:10,000
l just know.

1063
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
My dreams are much simpler
than all this.

1064
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
No dream is simple.

1065
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,000
Look at those people.

1066
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
They seem to be talking about
their own business.

1067
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Completely unaware of you.

1068
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
And yet, they could be there
because you...

1069
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
...wanted lt.
What's more,...

1070
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:31,000
...you could have them
at your complete service,...

1071
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
...or have them destroy you.

1072
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
l want them to be quiet.

1073
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
And you too.

1074
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,000
See?

1075
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
What's going on here?

1076
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
Someone tell me
the fucking truth!

1077
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:11,000
The truth?

1078
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Maybe you couldn't take lt.

1079
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
It had to be a set-up,
a big joke to delve me crazy.

1080
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,000
They all knew. Nuria, Pelayo,
the police, the guy at the bar.

1081
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
-Who was he?
-l don't know.

1082
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
You said you saw him on TV.
On what program?

1083
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:29,000
l don't know!

1084
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
l don't know.

1085
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,000
One that talked about
freezing the dead.

1086
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
-Freezing the dead?
-Cryonlzatlon.

1087
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Like they did to Walt Disney.

1088
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Maybe I can help you remember.

1089
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,000
Is that a threat?

1090
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Lie down.

1091
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,000
What's that?

1092
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:01,000
A syringe.

1093
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Relax.

1094
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,000
My arm's stinging.

1095
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
It's a tranquilliser.

1096
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,000
What for?

1097
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
These things are all bullshit.

1098
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
lf you'd trusted
psychiatrists more,...

1099
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
...you mightn't be here now.

1100
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
That flinger...

1101
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,000
-It's making me nervous.
-You needn't be afraid.

1102
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
-I'm not afraid.
-Stop talking and concentrate.

1103
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Come on.

1104
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:41,000
Fuck...

1105
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,000
l feel dizzy.

1106
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Good-bye, César.

1107
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Very good. Now let's see if you
can tell me about that dream.

1108
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Dream...

1109
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:59,000
-In my dream, it isn't raining.
-The office dream.

1110
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Ell...

1111
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:03,000
That's lt. I want you
to tell me who Ally is.

1112
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,000
-A secretary.
-Ell is a secretary?

1113
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
She tells me togo in.
They're expecting me.

1114
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:09,000
Who's expecting you?

1115
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,000
-The Frenchman from the TV.
-Sit down, please.

1116
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
It's a contract.

1117
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,000
-Ell...
-César, who is Ally?

1118
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
You won't regret lt.

1119
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Sign.

1120
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
-What are you signing?
-Ell will see to everything.

1121
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
What have you signed?

1122
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
What's wrong?

1123
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
What's wrong, César?

1124
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
-Why are you crying?
-I'm going to die.

1125
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
You're not going to die.

1126
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
-l don't know how many.
-How many what?

1127
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,000
-Pills.
-You took pills?

1128
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,000
-How many should I take?
-Pills to feel better?

1129
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,000
l don't want to.

1130
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
When I count to three,
you'll wake up.

1131
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
One... two...

1132
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
l thought that, up to now,
you'd told me the truth.

1133
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
What do you mean?

1134
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
You said you took nothing.

1135
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
César, I'll ask you
for the last time.

1136
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
-Did you take drugs?
-Fuck! Why does everyone...

1137
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Stop play-acting.
Tell me the truth!

1138
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
-l must know what you took.
-l didn't take anything!

1139
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Don't you see?

1140
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Your bran could have been
affected by the pills.

1141
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
-l didn't take any!
-You said you did!

1142
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:30,000
It's just a dream!

1143
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Why make it more important
than it is?

1144
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Can't you tell dreams
from reality? I can!

1145
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Really? Don't make me laugh!

1146
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Bodies that come to life,
people who disappear,...

1147
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
...you, the Phantom
of the Opera!

1148
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Tell me one thing.

1149
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,000
o you remember
what you did to Sofía?

1150
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:56,000
It wasn't Sofía.

1151
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,000
l don't care who it was.

1152
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,000
What did you do to her?

1153
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:02,000
You remember?

1154
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,000
My God!

1155
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
What are you doing?
l thought you were a burglar.

1156
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Who are you?

1157
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I'm Sofía.

1158
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Sofía...

1159
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:56,000
You're not Sofía.

1160
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
César, this will
all be over soon.

1161
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,000
We'll be together again.

1162
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
You'll forget Nuria
and I won't be afraid of you.

1163
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
-I'm thirsty.
-I'll get some water.

1164
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Sofía!

1165
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
Yes, César, I'm Sofía.

1166
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I'm Sofía.

1167
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
l want to see you.

1168
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:41,000
l want to see you.
l want to see you!

1169
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
l want to see you!

1170
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,000
At times you dream
you're with someone.

1171
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,000
For example, your father.

1172
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
In seconds, he becomes
your mother,...

1173
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
...and then, the newsvendor
on the corner.

1174
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Yet you still feel as if you're
talking to the same person.

1175
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
You thought you were
at home, but suddenly,...

1176
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
...you realize
you're in a school,...

1177
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:50,000
...or a hospital,...

1178
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
...or a prison.

1179
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Dreams are like that.

1180
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
And at times the mind behaves
as if it were in a dream.

1181
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
-You know what derangement is?
-For fuck's sake!

1182
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Say I'm stupid if you want,
but this isn't derangement!

1183
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Then what is it?

1184
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,000
You tell me,
because I don't know.

1185
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
l don't know what's in here,...

1186
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
...or why you killed
your girlfriend.

1187
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
l don't know who Ally is,
or that man from the TV.

1188
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,000
l don't know anything.

1189
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
That makes two of us.

1190
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Will you still come
after the trial?

1191
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Don't you hate the sight of me?

1192
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:39,000
What will you plead?

1193
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Why do you ask that?

1194
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
The first hearing
is next week.

1195
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Temporary derangement.

1196
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
It's your best chance.

1197
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Even so, it won't be much use.

1198
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
They won't believe me.

1199
01:26:58,000 --> 01:26:59,000
Even I don't believe lt.

1200
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
What do you believe?

1201
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
l think you're very sick,...

1202
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
...and should stay here
for a long time.

1203
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Don't worry. I'll get
at least twenty years.

1204
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
César, you may not believe it,
but I care about you.

1205
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
l care a lot about you.

1206
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:18,000
Look, kid.

1207
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Your case interests me.

1208
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
I'm sorry about
what's happened.

1209
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:26,000
l even thought someone was
playing tricks on you, but...

1210
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
...l can't and mustn't
exceed my duties.

1211
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,000
-I'm just a psychiatrist.
-You don't look like one.

1212
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
-What do I look like?
-My father.

1213
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:36,000
Preaching at me all day.

1214
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Your father's dead.

1215
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,000
There you go.

1216
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:49,000
By the way...

1217
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,000
What happened to that man with
the wife and two daughters?

1218
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
l don't know,
l never saw him again.

1219
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Take my advice, get a lawyer.

1220
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Good-bye, César.

1221
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Good-bye.

1222
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,000
...the main Spanish investment,
but certainly the most novel.

1223
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
...its economic presence
in Cuba.

1224
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
...depending on the era.

1225
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
In the Roman Empire,
for example,...

1226
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
...the normal thing
was to live...

1227
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
...only25years.

1228
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Who's got the remote?

1229
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:49,000
Give it to me!

1230
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Get it off him!

1231
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,000
What's up?

1232
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
There's a computer here
connected to internet.

1233
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
They'll only let me use it
lf you come with me.

1234
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
-Why do you want internet?
-l know what Ally is.

1235
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Walt!

1236
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Ell isn't a person,
It's a company.

1237
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
-How do you know?
-It isn't Ally.

1238
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:33,000
It's L.E. They're the initials
of an American company.

1239
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:37,000
-What are you doing?
-Checking the ''initials program''.

1240
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
It'll tell us all it knows
about L.E.

1241
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Shit!

1242
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:45,000
It'll take ages.

1243
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
No, wait.

1244
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Fuck!

1245
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
l feel like
I've done this before.

1246
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
A cerebral dysfunction.

1247
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
-A lapse in the brain.
-No, not this time.

1248
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
My God!

1249
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,000
-That's lt.
-The photo in your dream?

1250
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
l had to see it before I could
dream about it, right?

1251
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,000
''Cryonics''.

1252
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
-Cryonlzatlon.
-I'll print this.

1253
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Wait a minute.

1254
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,000
l don't see what this
has to do with your case.

1255
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,000
The key is in here.

1256
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Look, there's an office
in Madrid.

1257
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
I'll go and check it out.

1258
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:23,000
No!

1259
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
l have to go too.

1260
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:29,000
-l can't get you out of here.
-I'd be let out under supervision.

1261
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Make up some excuse.

1262
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
-It isn't easy.
-You can do lt.

1263
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,000
You know something else,
don't you?

1264
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
l don't know anything.

1265
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
-I've just got a feeling.
-What is it?

1266
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,000
l have to go there.

1267
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
One way or another.

1268
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Let's get things straight.

1269
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,000
We're outside, I'm armed.

1270
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:33,000
My job is to stop you
doing anything stupid.

1271
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Try anything,
and you get a bullet.

1272
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I've been here before.

1273
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
-This way.
-Move.

1274
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
You've got 20 minutes.

1275
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:41,000
It's just like in my dream.

1276
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Good morning,
can I help you?

1277
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Well, actually, we wanted
to speak to Mr. Duvernois.

1278
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,000
He's my son.

1279
01:32:58,000 --> 01:32:59,000
He's very shy.

1280
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Mr. Duvernois isn't here
right now.

1281
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
But, first of all, do you know
what cryonization is?

1282
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Well, more or less.

1283
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Here are some leaflets. You can
read them while you're waiting.

1284
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
One of my colleagues
will be with you soon.

1285
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:17,000
Thank you.

1286
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:20,000
''Live without limits.
Tomorrow is for the farsighted.''

1287
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
What is this?
Some kind of sect?

1288
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
''Cryonization is
the biostasis...

1289
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,000
...or preservation
of human beings.

1290
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
It is the bridge to carry
our patients to a future...

1291
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,000
...when technology will
restore them to life.''

1292
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
You pay to live eternally.

1293
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
They laughed at Jules Verne.

1294
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:45,000
César...

1295
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,000
All this is absolutely
impossible.

1296
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:49,000
What do you know
of the future?

1297
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:52,000
They promise what the Church
has always promised.

1298
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Immortality. Except they're
quacks, not priests.

1299
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
How are you involved?

1300
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,000
You're not cryonized.
You're alive.

1301
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,000
This is the contract,
lf you want to look at lt.

1302
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
The procedure is very simple.
You could die at any time.

1303
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,000
Today, tomorrow, in 20 years,
It doesn't matter to us.

1304
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:13,000
At the very moment you're
declared legally dead,...

1305
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
...Life Extension transfers your
body to our store in Arizona.

1306
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,000
There, it's frozen
at minus 78 degrees.

1307
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,000
We call that ''total suspension'',
and it costs 240,000 dollars.

1308
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
30,000 pays for the freezing
process, and the rest...

1309
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
...goes into
an investment fund,..

1310
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
...the interests from which
pay for maintenance,...

1311
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
...and resurrection costs,
the day that it's possible.

1312
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,000
lf it is possible.

1313
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:39,000
We believe that the reanimation
of the dead will be possible.

1314
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,000
-What's this?
-What?

1315
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Clause 14.

1316
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
-Artificial perception.
-It's a concept...

1317
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
...that we haven't
fully developed yet.

1318
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Look.

1319
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
This is a life.

1320
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Birth and death.

1321
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Let's say you've got
a terminal illness.

1322
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Of course, you want to go on
living, but not in the future.

1323
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
That doesn't interest you.
You want to live your life now.

1324
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Very well.

1325
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
You die, we freeze you,...

1326
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
...and when we can
resuscitate you,...

1327
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
...we'll have you live...

1328
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,000
...a dream.

1329
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:17,000
A dream?

1330
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
it will all look real.

1331
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Your family and friends,
your city,...

1332
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
...the world, even this office.
But It'll be a virtual reality.

1333
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:28,000
What's more, we'll make you
forget that you've died,...

1334
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,000
...and that you signed
this contract.

1335
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:31,000
-How?
-Very simple.

1336
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Wiping it from your memory.

1337
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
You'll live your life linearly,
as if nothing had happened.

1338
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:40,000
And best of all, you'll live it
as you like, as you wish.

1339
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
You'll decide at all times.

1340
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
But...

1341
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:46,000
What if there were mistakes?

1342
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
What if the dream was
transformed into a nightmare?

1343
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Well, the subconscious
can always play a dirty trick.

1344
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
But we're not cowboys,
this is a serious company.

1345
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,000
And virtual reality technology is
constantly making huge advances.

1346
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Look.

1347
01:36:03,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I'll be honest.

1348
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Signing Clause 14 is
like signing for paradise.

1349
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
It's hard to believe.

1350
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
But they laughed
at Jules Verne.

1351
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Excuse me.

1352
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
-Where are you going so fast?
-To the bathroom.

1353
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:31,000
-Well, not so fast.
-I'll go with him.

1354
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
He just felt ill, don't worry.

1355
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
César, calm down, please.

1356
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
This is a dream.
It's the only explanation.

1357
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
What he said is impossible.

1358
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:48,000
In the 20th century,
but maybe not in the 30th!

1359
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,000
-Maybe not, but we're in 1997.
-That's what it seems.

1360
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
-l paid for it to seem like that.
-Listen!

1361
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
lf this is a dream...
Look at me!

1362
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
lf this is a dream, it means
that I don't exist!

1363
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,000
l just imagine you.

1364
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,000
No!

1365
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
-César, I'm real.
-How do I know that?

1366
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:05,000
Can't you tell a dream
from reality?

1367
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Is this a dream, eh?

1368
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Tell me, is this a dream?

1369
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:14,000
César, I'm wearing myself out
over this case.

1370
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
There is no case, I didn't kill
anyone, it's all a nightmare!

1371
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Fuck it, César, trust me!

1372
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,000
This isn't a dream.

1373
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,000
They got it wrong.

1374
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
-Who?
-l don't know!

1375
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
But they mixed up
Sofía and Nuria!

1376
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
l see a face that isn't mine!

1377
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
I'm sick of hearing that!
Your face is fine.

1378
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:35,000
You're behaving like a child,
hiding behind that mask.

1379
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
-Go on, take it off!
-l don't want to see myself!

1380
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:40,000
l don't care about that.
l want to see you.

1381
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Don't you realize?
All that matters is what I see!

1382
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:44,000
It's my dream!

1383
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Say that once more...

1384
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
...and I'll have you locked up
in an asylum.

1385
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Show me your face.

1386
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Now. You owe it to me.

1387
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,000
César...

1388
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Look in the mirror and tell me
lf you think you're disfigured.

1389
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:22,000
God!

1390
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
Why do you keep seeing
what isn't there?

1391
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
-You look fine.
-I'm a monster!

1392
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:31,000
What do you mean?
Anybody'd like to have your face.

1393
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:32,000
You look normal.

1394
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Not just normal.
You're handsome!

1395
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:40,000
César, listen. Maybe you've got
something like anorexia.

1396
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Some girls insist they're fat
and end up crazy.

1397
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
César!

1398
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
l want to wake up!

1399
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
l want to wake up!

1400
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:53,000
-Hold it!
-l want to wake up!

1401
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Fuck!

1402
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,000
Shit!

1403
01:38:58,000 --> 01:38:59,000
Freeze!

1404
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Don't shoot!

1405
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
This is a nightmare!

1406
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
It's a nightmare!

1407
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
You! Wait a minute!

1408
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
You're not to leave!

1409
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Stop!

1410
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:29,000
Walt a minute!

1411
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
It's a dream!

1412
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:49,000
It's a dream!

1413
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Don't move!

1414
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Drop the gun!

1415
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
l want to wake up.

1416
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,000
-l want to wake up.
-Don't move!

1417
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
l want to wake up!

1418
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Antonio.

1419
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Antonio!

1420
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
What?

1421
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
You're crushing me.

1422
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I'd better not move.
I've been shot in the back.

1423
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
How do you know?

1424
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Well...

1425
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Because...

1426
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:09,000
What's going on here?

1427
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
What the fuck's going on?

1428
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
l told you, it's a dream.

1429
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Shut up! Shut up!

1430
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,000
l know what this is.

1431
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
It's one of those
Candid Camera jokes.

1432
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
You did a great job, I loved it,
but enough's enough!

1433
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
l see someone.

1434
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,000
Where?

1435
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Up there, on the roof.

1436
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
l can't see a thing.

1437
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Where are you going?

1438
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Come on, Antonio.
Don't think about it anymore.

1439
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Or you'll go crazy.

1440
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,000
Hello, César.

1441
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
It's time I introduced myself.

1442
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:05,000
My name is Serge Duvernois.
l represent Life Extension.

1443
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
We met...

1444
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:09,000
...150 years ago.

1445
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:10,000
What?

1446
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
-Has the world gone mad?
-There is no world.

1447
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,000
It's all in
that gentleman's mind.

1448
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
including you and l.

1449
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
Sure! Shall I thump you
to see if it hurts?

1450
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
Try lt.

1451
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,000
They can make you disappear
right now, like everyone else.

1452
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
-And who are ''they'', may I ask?
-The company.

1453
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
Life Extension.

1454
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
They know everything
we're saying.

1455
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
They even know what is going
through Cesar's mind now,...

1456
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,000
...an instant after
he thinks lt.

1457
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,000
lf they can make me disappear,
why haven't they done it?

1458
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:45,000
It would be virtually incorrect.

1459
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
You've just saved his life.

1460
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Virtually incorrect? Do you
think I'm an idiot or what?

1461
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
No, quite the opposite.
You're a great guy.

1462
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
A character who is very
necessary for César.

1463
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
A character?

1464
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
-Where are you going?
-To look for someone.

1465
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
There is no one.

1466
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
People aren't necessary now.

1467
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Why didn't you wake me before?

1468
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
You only had to ask.

1469
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
But that was difficult,...

1470
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
...because, in theory,...

1471
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:24,000
...you couldn't know
you were dreaming.

1472
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:26,000
Since when?

1473
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,000
Remember the day
of the discotheque?

1474
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
That night, when you fell asleep
on the sidewalk,...

1475
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
...was the one chosen
for the splice.

1476
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
-What splice?
-The splice...

1477
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:39,000
...between your real life
and your virtual life.

1478
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,000
A splice of 150 years
which you didn't notice...

1479
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
...because you were dead,
and frozen.

1480
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
From when you woke up,...

1481
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,000
...nothing was real.

1482
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
We wiped what really happened
from your memory.

1483
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:55,000
What was it?

1484
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
You never saw Sofía again.

1485
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:03,000
And the doctors were never able
to rebuild your face.

1486
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:06,000
You woke up on that street
with an awful hangover.

1487
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:09,000
You shut yourself away
for months.

1488
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:12,000
One day you learned
that we existed.

1489
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:15,000
You came to the office,
you signed the contract,...

1490
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:17,000
...and then,...

1491
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
...you killed yourself.

1492
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
I paid for this?

1493
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I paid for Nuria
to come back as Sofía?

1494
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:30,000
l paid to look like
a monster again?

1495
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
l paid to live this nightmare?

1496
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
You paid to live
whatever you wanted.

1497
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,000
We just provided the settling
and the characters.

1498
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:39,000
You invented your hell.

1499
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:41,000
l tried to warn you
in that bar.

1500
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:43,000
l said it all depended
on your mind.

1501
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Do I just have to want it?

1502
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
-Can Antonio come...
-There's no one here.

1503
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
They can't have made 4 million
people disappear!

1504
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:57,000
You've overcome your fears.

1505
01:44:57,000 --> 01:44:59,000
lf you want,
we can try again,...

1506
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
...have you live
a wonderful dream,...

1507
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:05,000
...with money, friends, Sofía,
or whatever girl you want.

1508
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,000
You just have to ask.

1509
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:12,000
l don't want more dreams.

1510
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:13,000
It isn't a dream!

1511
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,000
César, listen to me.

1512
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
This is real.
This man is a sham.

1513
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Let's go down
and look for people.

1514
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:24,000
ignore him. It's logical
for him to behave like this,...

1515
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:26,000
...but he doesn't
feel anything.

1516
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,000
l don't feel anything?

1517
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:32,000
l don't feel anything? What do
you know about what I feel?

1518
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Ignore him, he isn't real.

1519
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Yes, I am real!

1520
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I've got a wife,
and two daughters.

1521
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:43,000
His personality is designed
so that he'll say all this now.

1522
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Where are my daughters?

1523
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:46,000
-God!
-César...

1524
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
We can offer you
another possibility.

1525
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
In 1997, it was impossible
to rebuild your face.

1526
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:55,000
But out there
It's the year 2145.

1527
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:59,000
You wouldn't believe
the things surgery can do.

1528
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,000
You could wake up...

1529
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:03,000
...and live in the future
like a normal person.

1530
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,000
In the future?

1531
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:07,000
You have to choose.

1532
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
How could I wake up?

1533
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,000
How would you wake
from your worst nightmare?

1534
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,000
No, César, don't listen to him!

1535
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Your partners set this up!

1536
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:28,000
-They want you to kill yourself!
-He's done that.

1537
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Now it'll just be a formality.

1538
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,000
I'm going to do lt.

1539
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Very well.

1540
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Do you have any wish
before you...

1541
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
...die?

1542
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Let them out there read my mind.

1543
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Who are you?

1544
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
l don't know.

1545
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:04,000
Don't keep suffering.
It's all in your head.

1546
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,000
It's all psychological.

1547
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
Come on, César.

1548
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:50,000
-What will happen to them?
-Don't prolong this farewell.

1549
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
You think they're your friends,
but they're just images.

1550
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:55,000
That man isn't really crying.

1551
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
l forgot, I get vertigo.

1552
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Then don't look.

1553
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Good-bye, César.

1554
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Relax.

1555
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Relax.

1556
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Open your eyes.
