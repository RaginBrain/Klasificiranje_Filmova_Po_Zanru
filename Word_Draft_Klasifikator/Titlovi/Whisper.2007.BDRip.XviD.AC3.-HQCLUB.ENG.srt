00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:52,598
<i>And no wonder,
for Satan himself</i>

3
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,685
<i>masquerades as an
angel of light.</i>

4
00:02:51,502 --> 00:02:53,340
Where's the first-aid kit?

5
00:03:18,766 --> 00:03:19,576
David!

6
00:03:22,787 --> 00:03:23,863
Coming, Mom!

7
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:31,837
Whisper

8
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:33,929
Hey, Sid.

9
00:03:33,981 --> 00:03:35,460
Welcome back to the new world

10
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,505
Come on, check this out.

11
00:03:39,706 --> 00:03:41,306
Hey, you know what? Um, Max.

12
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:43,702
Look. I've got to be honest with you

13
00:03:43,804 --> 00:03:44,866
You wanna buy this place?

14
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:46,508
I won't even rob of this place

15
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:47,793
Yeah, it's gonna be all mine

16
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,211
Ours

17
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:50,277
Ours

18
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,457
Look just because you work in the kitchen inside
doesn't mean that's the only option around here, OK?

19
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:57,296
No, Sidney. Max is a businessman,
We've been working on menus.

20
00:03:57,578 --> 00:04:00,020
And you know what? I
've got a business plan.

21
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:02,462
And it ain't got nothing to do with
paper hats and napkins and menus

22
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:04,110
I've done with all that shit, Sid.

23
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:07,581
Hey, look. I 've got this sweet dig
this December with this guy named Jones

24
00:04:08,141 --> 00:04:12,239
We grab one little rich kid,
big pay day, everybody wins

25
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:15,354
Don't listen to him. OK?

26
00:04:17,327 --> 00:04:20,798
You know what? It's a nice idea.

27
00:04:20,835 --> 00:04:25,528
But think about it, Max. You've got no
money. No collab. No banks gonna touch you.

28
00:04:26,628 --> 00:04:27,973
I'm gonna do this, Sid.

29
00:04:29,482 --> 00:04:31,011
Well, I'm sure you will.

30
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:35,349
I'll call you in a couple
of weeks, OK? I mean it.

31
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,730
Get out of here.

32
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:43,021
It says here you've
worked food service before.

33
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:47,345
I've sure ordered in Quincy,
Walten. A few places in Newport

34
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:51,628
And with 50,000 dollars loan, you think you
resurrect the old Hazel Street Diner, huh?

35
00:04:53,636 --> 00:04:56,615
It's a corner shop, two busy streets,
a lot of foots and all the traffic.

36
00:04:56,988 --> 00:05:02,918
Yes, Mr Truemont. I've reviewed that. It's
not nothing. Not really something either.

37
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:13,057
How it go?

38
00:05:14,196 --> 00:05:15,012
Did you get it?

39
00:05:18,246 --> 00:05:19,346
You know, Sid called.

40
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,007
I'm gonna take that job, Rox.

41
00:05:25,996 --> 00:05:28,086
I have no place else to go.

42
00:05:32,554 --> 00:05:35,990
OK, sweetheart. I've got
to set up for your party.

43
00:05:36,344 --> 00:05:38,191
So Chloe can take over from here.

44
00:05:38,517 --> 00:05:40,289
But I like it better when you do it.

45
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:40,657
Sandborn's party?

46
00:06:41,994 --> 00:06:43,145
Abrakazzam!

47
00:06:45,345 --> 00:06:46,942
Weren't that great, guys?

48
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,967
It's beautiful, isn't it?

49
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:53,852
Now, hey. Don't you guys try
this at home with your pets now.

50
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:55,342
Are you ready?

51
00:06:55,823 --> 00:06:57,357
Let see if you can make them vanish.

52
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:58,386
1..

53
00:06:58,438 --> 00:06:59,414
Santa!

54
00:07:01,616 --> 00:07:04,819
Ho! Ho! Ho! One for everybody!

55
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,620
One for everybody!
- OK. OK.

56
00:07:07,621 --> 00:07:08,621
Careful. Alright.

57
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:11,322
Over here.

58
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:14,442
No fighting.

59
00:07:14,443 --> 00:07:15,443
OK. OK. OK. OK

60
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:30,541
Abrakazzam!

61
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:36,524
What you want for Christmas, David?

62
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:42,499
What do you want, Santa?

63
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,186
OK, birthday cake time.

64
00:07:54,998 --> 00:07:56,662
Chloe, do you know where David is?

65
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:57,906
No, I'm not sure.

66
00:08:16,514 --> 00:08:17,439
David!

67
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:21,910
Oh God

68
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:35,066
<i>Kidnapped your son</i>

69
00:08:36,111 --> 00:08:37,735
<i>Don't call the police
or we will kill him</i>

70
00:08:54,766 --> 00:08:55,857
I missed you, Sidney

71
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,667
I don't mind the new hair cut

72
00:09:04,648 --> 00:09:05,751
You still glad you came along?

73
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:09,759
What are you doing
here anyway? Yoko? Hunu?

74
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:11,800
I'm good with kids, Vince

75
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,682
I got two? What do you want?

76
00:09:14,683 --> 00:09:15,683
Err.. two

77
00:09:17,778 --> 00:09:19,372
What the hell is that?

78
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,629
I must missed one.

79
00:09:21,376 --> 00:09:22,192
No shit

80
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:25,601
Don't matter. Here's our boy.

81
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:26,881
Alright

82
00:09:28,154 --> 00:09:29,087
I hope he took the right one.

83
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:47,972
Sidney

84
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:49,483
Take it easy

85
00:09:49,726 --> 00:09:50,853
Stop it

86
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:54,799
Is everything OK, guys?

87
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:58,024
Yeah. Just run out of gas.

88
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:01,155
It's OK. It's OK.
We've got 'em covered.

89
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:06,304
Bobby, where the hell are
you? I've got two flats in 128

90
00:10:12,093 --> 00:10:14,617
Bobby. For Christ's sake, I'm
talking to you, you lazy ass.

91
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,011
Help me

92
00:10:28,191 --> 00:10:29,106
What if he sees?

93
00:10:29,411 --> 00:10:30,281
Probably not

94
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,149
Not here

95
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:34,922
Max, get the van. Let's go.

96
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:36,566
Fine

97
00:10:37,224 --> 00:10:39,081
But.. but, he would
have seen anything.

98
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:53,439
Do you want me to get you up?

99
00:10:54,671 --> 00:10:55,867
You will never get up

100
00:11:21,071 --> 00:11:23,158
Ms. Sandborn. I am Detective Witley.

101
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:23,437
Do you think you can find him?

102
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:26,809
Ma'am, as I said on the phone
we are pursuing all leads

103
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,449
In fact the matter is, the
kidnapper will probably call.

104
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:29,614
They usually do.

105
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,938
Ms. Sanborne. Detective Miles.

106
00:11:32,939 --> 00:11:35,963
Look, I know this is a difficult time,
but I need the list of your employees..

107
00:11:36,284 --> 00:11:37,915
Miles, can I talk
with you for a minute?

108
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:38,888
Excuse me

109
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:48,368
I got this covered. Alright? So you just watch,
take some notes and see how we do this up here.

110
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:49,369
OK, kiddo?

111
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:42,979
I thought this is the summer camp.

112
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:47,557
And how did you get
your hand on this place?

113
00:12:48,555 --> 00:12:51,030
They've already gave me a
couple of bucks to watch it one.

114
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:55,047
Watch it one and collapse.

115
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,476
We all have better days.

116
00:12:58,252 --> 00:13:00,866
Come on, let's get him inside...
It's not getting warmer around here.

117
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:02,895
It's frickin' freezing

118
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:25,329
Alright... I just
gonna put this on you

119
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,630
and get you inside where
it's warm. OK, buddy?

120
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,417
Alright. It's nothing.
It's just the wind, buddy.

121
00:13:56,594 --> 00:13:58,147
Get out of here!

122
00:14:06,536 --> 00:14:08,262
What? It's just a dog.

123
00:14:10,689 --> 00:14:12,684
God blessed the 5th amendment

124
00:14:56,154 --> 00:14:57,251
Nothing to be scared of

125
00:14:57,252 --> 00:14:58,752
It'll be OK. I promise, alright?

126
00:15:01,142 --> 00:15:02,249
I have to go to the bathroom

127
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:05,331
You've got your very
own bathroom just inside

128
00:15:06,133 --> 00:15:08,001
Inside where? Where am I?

129
00:15:08,673 --> 00:15:10,497
Don't worry about that, David.

130
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,863
Just work with us. Cooperate.

131
00:15:17,464 --> 00:15:19,064
Hell, I don't know.
Think of this as game.

132
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,580
Are they going to hurt me?

133
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:26,852
No. Relax, buddy.

134
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,670
I'll give you an ice-cream
later. Would you like that?

135
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,689
Alright

136
00:15:35,168 --> 00:15:36,664
In you go

137
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:47,377
You can take off your
blindfold now, David

138
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:49,810
Oh, you are a regular dent mother!

139
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:51,796
Vince

140
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:16,317
Sidney. if you let me know, I could
have brought my things and then..

141
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:17,618
we've could have more channels
then you know what to do then

142
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:29,360
I know I don't have to warn you, but
don't get too in touch with that kid. OK?

143
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:30,900
I got this

144
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:34,400
I'll put this up next.
- OK, thanks.

145
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:38,046
Oh, wi wi poo poo. What
is this foreign shit?

146
00:16:38,568 --> 00:16:40,818
We are near the border, Vince.

147
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:42,984
Border of what? África?

148
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:55,390
Hey, there we go.

149
00:16:55,391 --> 00:16:59,391
Hey, all we need now is pizza. We've
get ourselves one hell of the evening

150
00:16:59,492 --> 00:16:59,592
Hey!

151
00:17:00,357 --> 00:17:02,281
Damn, Mother. You see any phone book?

152
00:17:02,543 --> 00:17:05,283
Put it dowm... It sure find a way
to lead the people to us around

153
00:17:06,727 --> 00:17:10,314
Oh, hi mum. I'm in camp. I'm
gonna have fun for a few days.

154
00:17:29,989 --> 00:17:35,056
It's gonna be fine. I won't let
anything happen to him, you know that?

155
00:17:37,074 --> 00:17:38,822
I wish this will be over.

156
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:42,059
It'll be soon.

157
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:48,860
Bed time.

158
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,161
I found you this. I
thought you might get cold.

159
00:17:59,896 --> 00:18:01,192
Why are you wearing that?

160
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:03,952
Well, it's so you won't see who I am.

161
00:18:05,903 --> 00:18:07,940
You try to get some sleep, OK?

162
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:14,311
Looks uncomfortable. I won't
peek if you want to take it off.

163
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:29,587
OK, but it has to be our secret.

164
00:18:30,268 --> 00:18:32,468
OK... I promise.

165
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:51,290
<i > Late night I'll be at oasis
send your camels to bed < /i>

166
00:19:24,466 --> 00:19:25,436
Do you love me, Max?

167
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,523
Maybe.

168
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:43,747
We'll have the money, and we'll
remove that if you hate it so much.

169
00:19:44,377 --> 00:19:48,952
It can't be remove. The
scar I can bear but fear.

170
00:19:52,593 --> 00:19:54,890
Baby, do you think we're bad people?

171
00:19:56,503 --> 00:19:59,109
There is no commend
getting in kidnapping

172
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,152
It's stealing though

173
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:06,063
It's not stealing. Borrowing.

174
00:20:08,382 --> 00:20:11,539
The kid's mother pays Jones.
David will back home tomorrow night

175
00:20:12,162 --> 00:20:13,585
Who is this Jones anyway?

176
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,071
Doesn't matter. Sidney
also don't know Jones.

177
00:20:17,172 --> 00:20:19,172
We'll get our half for
snatching the kid from home.

178
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:20,173
They did the exchange
when it is pay off.

179
00:20:21,487 --> 00:20:22,924
Yeah, everybody wins.

180
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,816
Everybody wins.

181
00:20:57,817 --> 00:20:59,317
Max

182
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:04,396
What is it, baby?

183
00:21:05,671 --> 00:21:08,082
Nothing. I'm sorry I had a bad dream.

184
00:21:09,211 --> 00:21:10,572
It's OK.

185
00:21:12,092 --> 00:21:13,670
I'm hearing voices.

186
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:17,794
Will you check on David?

187
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:21,952
Yup
- Thanks

188
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:31,214
I don't like it here.

189
00:21:53,634 --> 00:21:54,557
Shit

190
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:58,158
I'd put you on bed.
I'm not try to scare ya.

191
00:21:59,006 --> 00:22:00,831
Why was my window open, Max?

192
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:10,503
Don't let the others hear you
calling me that, you understand?

193
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,374
Sorry. Sometimes you heard
things you don't want to.

194
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,915
Come on. It's alright. Go to bed.

195
00:22:40,536 --> 00:22:44,405
Argh! Goddammit. The lil'
bastard busted my insulin.

196
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:46,097
Hey, hey. Calm down.

197
00:22:46,342 --> 00:22:48,699
He.. he was in the trunk. He
must've kicked it or something.

198
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,962
He didn't do it on purpose.

199
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:51,586
Just relax, man. How
long do you need more?

200
00:22:51,623 --> 00:22:54,461
Every morning, man. Right
now. Alright. Give me the keys

201
00:22:54,462 --> 00:22:56,004
There must a pharmacy
around here somewhere.

202
00:22:56,056 --> 00:22:58,722
There is one down the road but they're
gonna know you. Wait, we can't have that.

203
00:22:59,033 --> 00:23:00,890
Well, I'll go to
Portsmith.! Give me the keys!

204
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,735
No, no. The cut is too close I have to
be at Welsham by 5 to talk with Jones.

205
00:23:04,995 --> 00:23:06,821
I told ya that one car
thing was a bad idea.

206
00:23:07,072 --> 00:23:08,744
The only bad idea is
bringing you along.

207
00:23:09,415 --> 00:23:11,774
Hey! You take it easy.

208
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:13,704
Max, take him to Portsmith.

209
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:15,580
Got your prescriptions?
- Yes.

210
00:23:15,616 --> 00:23:17,075
Everything you need?
- Yes!

211
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:19,368
Alright. Go. Get him
the hell out of here.

212
00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:20,369
Oh no!

213
00:23:23,623 --> 00:23:25,177
Come here, you little bastard!

214
00:23:25,214 --> 00:23:25,846
Just leave him alone!

215
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:26,847
Knock it off!

216
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,070
He'd seen our faces

217
00:23:34,003 --> 00:23:35,859
Let me just think a minute, alright?

218
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,187
Max, did you lock the door after
you looked at him last night?

219
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:39,737
What did she just say?

220
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,275
What did you do? What, did you
just tuck him in or something?

221
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,624
I swear I locked it.

222
00:23:47,933 --> 00:23:52,560
You better than that. You know
what these means, don't you?

223
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,281
He probably knows our names too.

224
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:58,504
That freak kid will screw up again.

225
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,805
He'd seen our faces.

226
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:01,706
I don't know whether we
should let him go now.

227
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:02,807
What?

228
00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:05,408
Just stop doing
anything till I get back.

229
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:08,409
Max. - Fine -
Hello! Diabetic!

230
00:24:17,647 --> 00:24:21,622
Just a little bit more. Right
there. Good. Stay right there.

231
00:24:56,266 --> 00:24:57,925
Alright. You hungry?

232
00:24:59,106 --> 00:25:00,179
We gotta get back.

233
00:25:00,506 --> 00:25:03,824
Man, Sidney never believe we got
Portsmith back that quick. Come on.

234
00:25:04,466 --> 00:25:07,183
Just let kill few hours around
here just to cover ourselves.

235
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,457
Alright.

236
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:15,534
<i>You have sown the wind and shall
reap a whirlwind, Hosea 87</i>

237
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:23,496
Yes?

238
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:44,668
You're not helping
yourself around here, kid.

239
00:25:45,157 --> 00:25:46,114
Am I in trouble?

240
00:25:46,331 --> 00:25:48,616
I don't know. That
all depends on you.

241
00:25:50,161 --> 00:25:55,748
You think you can aa.. forget about what
we look like? Our faces, voices, names?

242
00:25:58,001 --> 00:25:58,877
Why?

243
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:01,033
Why?

244
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,874
How about I give you
a lil' bedtime story?

245
00:26:06,653 --> 00:26:11,051
Couple years back, me and partner
doing job on this registry.

246
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:15,536
Everything has gone real smooth like untill
the teller tripped and sound the alarm

247
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:25,540
We warned her. Don't touch it. Don't
go near it. But she did it anyway.

248
00:26:26,922 --> 00:26:32,432
Now, my partner. Well, he was
forced to blow her brain out.

249
00:26:32,863 --> 00:26:38,062
Put the bullet right through her
head. Bang. Well, there you have it.

250
00:26:40,107 --> 00:26:42,593
Nobody like a squealer.

251
00:26:47,611 --> 00:26:48,785
Nice. What is it?

252
00:26:49,122 --> 00:26:54,161
The teller's beads necklace. It broke
and it beads spilled all over the floor.

253
00:26:55,858 --> 00:26:56,990
How do you know that?

254
00:26:58,365 --> 00:27:00,481
I know a lot of things.

255
00:27:02,124 --> 00:27:05,546
And I know it wasn't your
partner that killed the teller.

256
00:27:06,287 --> 00:27:08,376
That was not what
you told the police.

257
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:13,695
You've told this story so many
times until you actually believe it

258
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:21,322
And I know something else.

259
00:27:21,719 --> 00:27:23,603
What's that? What do you know?

260
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:27,322
I know that you're about
to have a heart attack.

261
00:27:29,683 --> 00:27:31,477
Trying to scare me?

262
00:27:48,496 --> 00:27:50,153
Too bad the car's not here.

263
00:27:56,595 --> 00:27:57,490
Stop.

264
00:27:58,174 --> 00:28:02,552
That was your plan, right? One
car means few complications.

265
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:07,042
I'm afraid you're
gonna die here, Sidney.

266
00:28:07,556 --> 00:28:12,153
In this lonely little cabin and sit
around grovel in the living room.

267
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:17,692
Sidney

268
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:19,785
Sidney

269
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:27,986
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

270
00:28:31,662 --> 00:28:32,411
I'm sorry. Wrong number.

271
00:28:35,135 --> 00:28:38,241
I'm sorry, Sidney.
Max will be here soon.

272
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:41,933
No. We can't let
them know we are here.

273
00:28:41,934 --> 00:28:44,334
Hang on, OK? Max will be here soon

274
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:46,035
We'll be OK, then.

275
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:03,796
Max, baby. It's Sidney.
His heart. I'm so sorry, Max

276
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:10,364
David was keeping me company.
I was afraid to be alone, Max.

277
00:29:12,189 --> 00:29:14,153
Sorry about Mr. Braverman.

278
00:29:14,154 --> 00:29:15,154
Really, really sorry.

279
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:28,505
There's a lot of spiders. I
thought they hibernated in winter.

280
00:29:29,137 --> 00:29:30,935
I wonder where the hive is?

281
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:33,312
The ground too frozen to bury him in.

282
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,677
We'll leave him here a couple of
days. Take him with us when we go.

283
00:30:03,722 --> 00:30:05,179
Bigger share now.

284
00:30:06,357 --> 00:30:07,593
The kid just bring bad luck.

285
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:09,921
So what are we gonna do?

286
00:30:09,957 --> 00:30:14,409
We got two choices. We drop the kid
by the highway and call in the bust.

287
00:30:14,746 --> 00:30:17,827
Wait, wait. Now, this is all for nothing and
we go back to be in broke? No, Goddamn way!

288
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:22,003
Or I go to that ring.
Try to find Jones.

289
00:30:23,937 --> 00:30:25,877
I'm sure if this still
on, we'll get paid.

290
00:30:25,914 --> 00:30:27,776
Yes, and it's bigger share now.

291
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:32,236
Vince, I swear God,
you and anyone else.

292
00:30:33,703 --> 00:30:35,655
Sidney's share goes to his niece.

293
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:38,578
Alright. Whatever.

294
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:40,388
So, you're going to speak with Jones?

295
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:44,927
Wait. I thought we were
voting. I voted we let David go.

296
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:46,884
I've got a bad feeling
about this whole thing.

297
00:30:47,117 --> 00:30:47,828
Max?

298
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,832
Take this. For protection.

299
00:31:09,138 --> 00:31:10,727
From what? Elves?

300
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,752
<i>Little boy abducted</i>

301
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:42,428
<i>Scion of Beacon Hill family
grabbed from own 8th birthday</i>

302
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:59,226
Where is Sidney?

303
00:32:00,026 --> 00:32:02,438
He died. He's dead.

304
00:32:03,412 --> 00:32:04,262
He had heart attack.

305
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:07,545
That's so unfortunate.
Does the child still alive?

306
00:32:08,046 --> 00:32:09,188
Of course

307
00:32:09,821 --> 00:32:13,306
I took the picture.
His mother wants prove.

308
00:32:15,738 --> 00:32:18,056
What the? I'll take another one.

309
00:32:18,414 --> 00:32:21,470
Don't bother. You prepared
to call the mother, right?

310
00:32:23,824 --> 00:32:25,073
Yeah, tonight.

311
00:32:25,316 --> 00:32:26,671
You have what you need?

312
00:32:26,913 --> 00:32:30,989
Yeah. Untraceable phone
scrambler. Expert dug it all up.

313
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:35,732
The guy's a pro.

314
00:32:36,417 --> 00:32:40,027
Then, meet me at Boston
Park Avenue noon tomorrow.

315
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:43,636
You give the details off and your
money vanish. And watch your back.

316
00:32:45,953 --> 00:32:47,356
So these are all the images of the marks
- Uh huh

317
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:50,664
Excuse me.

318
00:32:50,891 --> 00:32:52,397
Ah, detective. It's
nice of you to join us.

319
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:54,450
The kid must be on a sippy time.

320
00:32:56,838 --> 00:32:59,801
So, can we narrow
down the car or more?

321
00:32:59,837 --> 00:33:01,868
Not really. But I seriously
look for a big American car.

322
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,581
What about the van?

323
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:06,953
Wiped clean before they torched it. But I
can be bit more thorough when we tow it in.

324
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:08,289
So we got nothing.

325
00:33:08,947 --> 00:33:12,877
Not necessarily. Look. At least
two these things are the prints.

326
00:33:12,878 --> 00:33:15,172
Including a clean
thumb and four fingers.

327
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:16,973
Chances are somebody got the record.

328
00:33:17,797 --> 00:33:19,520
Ah, that's good. It's real good.

329
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:35,526
Come to take a ride, OK?

330
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,145
Where are we going?

331
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:39,618
Just got a few more things to
do, before we can get you home.

332
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:41,099
But I'm having fun here.

333
00:33:41,556 --> 00:33:43,255
Not sure I wanna go home just yet.

334
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:46,706
What do you mean,
buddy? Of course, you do.

335
00:33:47,438 --> 00:33:48,922
Come on. Let's go

336
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,385
Baby, we should turn back.

337
00:34:14,382 --> 00:34:15,785
Too late for that.

338
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:23,575
Keep him down.

339
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:25,778
Sorry, sweetie.

340
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:33,055
You can look now, David

341
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:40,922
Alright. Scrambler,
ready. Decoder, we're on.

342
00:34:41,144 --> 00:34:42,236
They might not be able to trace us.

343
00:34:43,866 --> 00:34:45,332
I'm calling your mom, David.

344
00:34:45,822 --> 00:34:46,849
Oh, good.

345
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:54,466
We're on. Don't tap
up the whole wire.

346
00:34:57,938 --> 00:34:59,120
OK

347
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:01,521
Yes?

348
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,172
Ms. Sandborn?

349
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:04,173
Speaking.

350
00:35:04,174 --> 00:35:05,174
We have your boy.

351
00:35:07,871 --> 00:35:09,355
I want proves he's alive.

352
00:35:09,817 --> 00:35:10,741
Yeah, alright.

353
00:35:13,242 --> 00:35:14,342
OK.

354
00:35:17,711 --> 00:35:18,464
David?

355
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:21,608
David, it's that you?

356
00:35:24,473 --> 00:35:25,987
Come on, buddy. You're almost there.

357
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:29,576
Get him say something.

358
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,374
Say something.

359
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:37,215
Just say hello.

360
00:35:37,922 --> 00:35:39,451
Come on, David. Don't be scared.

361
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:41,697
Yes, be scared.

362
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:45,514
You'll be very scared when you know
who I am and what I'm gonna do..

363
00:35:45,874 --> 00:35:48,662
It's OK. You just say hello, honey.

364
00:35:50,513 --> 00:35:54,623
Go ahead.
- Goddammit, say something.

365
00:35:55,581 --> 00:35:56,690
Alright!
- Vince, don't hurt him!

366
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:58,174
Hey, what are you doing?!

367
00:35:58,175 --> 00:35:59,175
Back off!

368
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:00,282
Vince, stop it! David,
it's OK. It's OK.

369
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:03,143
She.. she just said my name!

370
00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:06,034
What's happening?

371
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:07,711
Damn it! You just told my name!
- Back off!

372
00:36:07,984 --> 00:36:09,206
Why did you do that for?!
- Leave the kid!

373
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:12,953
Take it off, Max!

374
00:36:15,301 --> 00:36:16,625
What are you doing?!

375
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:19,717
We lost them.

376
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:22,217
OK, let's get things
double next time.

377
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:24,218
Did you get the match?

378
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,219
No.

379
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:26,482
Any signal trace data?
- No

380
00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:29,483
I'm sorry you had to hear..

381
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,666
Is David alive?

382
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:33,341
We didn't get the voice match.
Didn't have the location.

383
00:36:33,944 --> 00:36:34,946
Is he dead?

384
00:36:35,231 --> 00:36:36,177
Did they kill him?!

385
00:36:36,685 --> 00:36:38,499
Catherine, we don't
know. We have no idea.

386
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:44,637
So, what you guys wanna do now?

387
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:47,649
Like really go for that ice-cream?

388
00:36:48,252 --> 00:36:49,368
Alright, that's it!
- Vince!

389
00:36:49,606 --> 00:36:50,704
Don't you hurt him!

390
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:57,270
It's OK. It's OK. Everything's fine.

391
00:36:57,647 --> 00:36:58,834
It's not OK!

392
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:01,767
What are you doing, Max?

393
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,843
I should have done
it a long time ago!

394
00:37:04,587 --> 00:37:08,293
Stop using my damn name. It's
good for a kid who ended up dead.

395
00:37:08,329 --> 00:37:10,127
Will I be your first?

396
00:37:26,624 --> 00:37:27,567
Max, look out!

397
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:31,499
What the hell was that?

398
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:34,450
Did you see that?

399
00:37:46,568 --> 00:37:47,179
Max?

400
00:38:34,207 --> 00:38:35,300
You can't sleep, huh?

401
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,245
A nightmare.

402
00:38:39,648 --> 00:38:40,858
Do you want some company?

403
00:38:42,221 --> 00:38:44,210
No thanks. Vince, I want to be alone.

404
00:39:11,923 --> 00:39:13,976
Please forgive me.

405
00:39:19,229 --> 00:39:20,168
Vince?

406
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:38,654
Vince?

407
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,083
Vince, is that you down there?

408
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:10,841
Your move.

409
00:41:11,987 --> 00:41:13,386
Hey, who let you out?

410
00:41:13,668 --> 00:41:14,546
Nobody

411
00:41:15,536 --> 00:41:16,485
Where's Max?

412
00:41:16,723 --> 00:41:18,895
He went to go talk with
someone called Jones.

413
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,101
Hm. I'm glad someone
up with these things.

414
00:41:24,097 --> 00:41:25,277
Where's Roxanne?

415
00:41:26,338 --> 00:41:27,445
Why?

416
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:34,471
Hey, listen. After that stunt you pull last night,
you should be laying down in the cell next to Sid.

417
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,067
You couldn't kill me.
You don't have it in you.

418
00:41:48,084 --> 00:41:49,120
Wanna play?

419
00:42:09,919 --> 00:42:11,073
Morning, honey.

420
00:42:14,479 --> 00:42:18,783
How come she's not your girlfriend?
The way she acts around you..

421
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:20,884
.. seems like she likes you.

422
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,435
What the hell do you know?

423
00:42:25,355 --> 00:42:29,917
Last night I could hear through
the walls. She was praying.

424
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,791
She was asking for God's forgiveness.

425
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:40,572
For a secret. A secret that
she's been keeping, even from Max

426
00:42:42,031 --> 00:42:43,163
What secret?

427
00:42:45,012 --> 00:42:48,725
<i>"The gruesome discovery was made today
outside the tunnel of the plant remains.."</i>

428
00:42:49,626 --> 00:42:55,126
<i>"The body of 17 years old girl was found in
an abandoned car in the local rock core."</i>

429
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:57,327
<i>"The authority was holding
a young man for questions."</i>

430
00:43:06,011 --> 00:43:07,185
Oh my God!

431
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:11,701
Vince, don't sneak up on me, OK?

432
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:14,831
Did you hear that?

433
00:43:18,185 --> 00:43:19,163
No

434
00:43:22,673 --> 00:43:23,977
It was nothing.

435
00:43:28,665 --> 00:43:30,054
What's the matter, princess?

436
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,341
I think about Sidney.
I could've save him.

437
00:43:37,383 --> 00:43:40,302
Wait. That wasn't your fault.

438
00:43:42,004 --> 00:43:43,919
It's not your fault, baby.

439
00:43:44,093 --> 00:43:45,205
Thanks, Vince.

440
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,903
Have you ever missed me?

441
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:50,450
No. Can I go?

442
00:43:50,952 --> 00:43:52,014
Sometimes, I missed you.

443
00:43:53,919 --> 00:43:55,321
You asshole.

444
00:43:56,023 --> 00:43:57,266
You swore that you
wouldn't say anything.

445
00:43:57,522 --> 00:43:59,334
Deal is a deal. OK?

446
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:02,800
But you have been keeping secrets.

447
00:44:02,837 --> 00:44:04,104
Which secrets?

448
00:44:05,131 --> 00:44:08,440
I know about our
baby. And what you did.

449
00:44:08,477 --> 00:44:10,026
How? I never told anybody.

450
00:44:10,063 --> 00:44:13,383
Then, why you shouldn't told me.?

451
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:17,749
Vince, it was a mistake.

452
00:44:18,877 --> 00:44:23,701
It's OK. I just want
you one more time.

453
00:44:24,711 --> 00:44:28,181
Rox. If Max knew what you did,

454
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:32,882
.. you think he will still
see you fit to be mother?

455
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,942
Our secret

456
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:54,942
Our secret

457
00:45:27,705 --> 00:45:29,187
Your call was a disaster

458
00:45:29,689 --> 00:45:32,869
I know. It was a mess.
Damn kid are hands full.

459
00:45:32,905 --> 00:45:36,048
I didn't ask you for report card.
- Yeah

460
00:45:38,261 --> 00:45:40,617
Obviously we're not
arranging a withdraw today.

461
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,936
The reason I had to drive
5 hours to hear that?

462
00:45:42,973 --> 00:45:47,554
Well, Max. If you are able to provide proof
of life we wouldn't have these problem.

463
00:45:48,675 --> 00:45:50,754
See what's in front of you?

464
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:56,674
We are around the box.
The one inspired him, death

465
00:45:57,295 --> 00:45:58,303
What this got to do with it?

466
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:04,109
It doesn't got anything to do with it.
You only got one choice now. Kill the kid.

467
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,395
You heard me. Grabbed
the kid, not kill him.

468
00:46:06,432 --> 00:46:08,441
It was one bad call.
We'll call again.

469
00:46:09,149 --> 00:46:12,243
Her mother would pay.
Any parent would pay.

470
00:46:14,415 --> 00:46:16,737
We're not done until we
get the money. You got me?

471
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:20,113
No, you don't get me, Max.
You're gonna do what I tell you.

472
00:46:20,114 --> 00:46:21,886
Be prepare to dispose the body.

473
00:46:21,941 --> 00:46:24,347
You must be aware with
all the possibilities.

474
00:46:24,383 --> 00:46:26,752
I'm not killing anyone.
And sure not an 8 year old.

475
00:46:27,265 --> 00:46:29,662
Huh! If only you knew
who you are dealing with.

476
00:46:29,698 --> 00:46:34,891
Listen, Jones. I don't give a
damn who you are. I ain't doing it.

477
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:38,459
The last thing I could cut off
his ear and send it to his mom..

478
00:46:38,802 --> 00:46:41,332
Less effective than
what you might think.

479
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:45,829
Return the phone. We'll meet tomorrow morning
for the last time time. Your restaurant.

480
00:47:44,089 --> 00:47:45,158
What's the deal, Jones?
- What?

481
00:47:45,415 --> 00:47:48,607
Jones? I'm not Jones. I don't know
what are you talking about. I swear!

482
00:47:48,644 --> 00:47:50,430
What the hell is this?

483
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,215
I'm not Jones, man. I
don't know any Jones.

484
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:04,792
Then who the hell called me?

485
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:09,113
Somebody said they pay me, OK? To leave the
phone and pick it up once it was put back

486
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:13,889
You got the pay check.
What he looked like?

487
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,916
What did you do?

488
00:51:53,731 --> 00:51:55,067
Is that your remember?

489
00:51:56,968 --> 00:51:59,122
Hey, kid.
- Abrakazzam

490
00:51:59,174 --> 00:52:01,276
That's cute. Give it here.

491
00:52:01,864 --> 00:52:04,195
I give to Max when I tell him.

492
00:52:04,232 --> 00:52:05,595
Tell him what?

493
00:52:05,631 --> 00:52:06,958
About you and Roxanne.

494
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:10,225
Oh. Check.

495
00:52:15,211 --> 00:52:19,644
Do you like games,
huh? I know a game.

496
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:29,102
Come on. Down there.

497
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,981
David?

498
00:52:40,003 --> 00:52:40,747
So where we going?

499
00:52:41,123 --> 00:52:43,912
Play my game. OK? I'm
going to show you something.

500
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:49,277
Stop right there.

501
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,047
Do you see that? To the trees?

502
00:52:54,048 --> 00:52:55,448
Just keep looking.

503
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:02,089
I don't like this game

504
00:53:02,638 --> 00:53:03,878
Are you gonna cry?

505
00:53:09,823 --> 00:53:12,068
Oh, I thought you might need that.

506
00:53:18,192 --> 00:53:18,983
No.

507
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,949
Got some more to say? Huh?!

508
00:53:27,062 --> 00:53:29,013
Please. Don't kill me

509
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:45,538
I told you. You still
don't have it in you.

510
00:53:48,206 --> 00:53:49,645
David! Come back here!

511
00:53:50,376 --> 00:53:51,354
David?

512
00:53:53,179 --> 00:53:54,322
David!

513
00:54:06,581 --> 00:54:07,509
David?

514
00:54:36,219 --> 00:54:37,667
Your move, Vince.

515
00:54:53,215 --> 00:54:54,279
Very clever.

516
00:55:02,312 --> 00:55:04,076
I'm just gonna wait right here.

517
00:55:05,832 --> 00:55:09,536
Well, you see. The
longer you make me wait..

518
00:55:17,246 --> 00:55:18,348
Are you done running?

519
00:55:19,926 --> 00:55:21,802
Good. Very good.

520
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:25,914
Because I'm gonna break you legs.

521
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:27,033
David

522
00:55:36,653 --> 00:55:39,957
You wanna yell out for Max?
Maybe he could help you.

523
00:55:40,469 --> 00:55:42,140
But who's gonna help you?

524
00:55:43,095 --> 00:55:44,131
Are you threatening me?

525
00:55:50,446 --> 00:55:51,293
Jesús!

526
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:53,069
No. Not Jesús.

527
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:07,149
Checkmate

528
00:56:51,315 --> 00:56:52,227
David!

529
00:56:56,303 --> 00:56:57,308
He fell!

530
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:11,212
I got you.

531
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:35,217
Yeah?

532
00:57:35,583 --> 00:57:36,696
It's Marla.

533
00:57:36,697 --> 00:57:40,869
FDA licensing database got
a hit on Vincent Delayo.

534
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,642
Looks like he filled an order
for insulin two days ago.

535
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:43,715
I thought that might
just work. Where?

536
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:49,363
Regie's Pharmacy, 227 Maine Street,
Welsham, Maine. I'll call Whitney now.

537
00:57:49,364 --> 00:57:50,264
Don't.

538
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:52,697
I'll tell him for you.

539
00:57:54,507 --> 00:57:55,826
See you soon, kiddo.

540
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,373
Your eyelids look heavy.

541
00:58:10,394 --> 00:58:12,250
Dreams. Bad dreams, David.

542
00:58:15,321 --> 00:58:16,570
No more Vince though.

543
00:58:23,763 --> 00:58:25,001
That was the most horrible thing.

544
00:58:25,942 --> 00:58:27,684
Did it make you just
a little bit happy?

545
00:58:29,941 --> 00:58:30,993
Happy?

546
00:58:32,825 --> 00:58:34,725
You think what happened
to Vince made me happy?

547
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:37,526
I can see it in your eyes.

548
00:58:39,229 --> 00:58:42,145
I heard that the eyes are
the window of the soul.

549
00:59:03,473 --> 00:59:04,289
David!

550
00:59:05,592 --> 00:59:07,225
Could you leave us a few minutes?

551
00:59:07,668 --> 00:59:08,790
No problem, Max.

552
00:59:17,069 --> 00:59:18,258
Sorry I was away.

553
00:59:19,398 --> 00:59:20,900
Then don't go see Jones tomorrow.

554
00:59:21,448 --> 00:59:22,715
I have to get our money.

555
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:26,308
No. Baby, everytime you
leave, something awful happens.

556
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,294
Look. Just let David go
tonight. Can we please..

557
00:59:28,663 --> 00:59:30,267
Rox, we need the money.

558
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,408
That's what happens when everybody
wins. Your friends are dead.

559
00:59:33,509 --> 00:59:34,659
I've no idea why we trap here.

560
00:59:34,711 --> 00:59:38,446
And these things I hear in the middle of night. I wake
up and I hear like somebody putting ideas in my head

561
00:59:38,656 --> 00:59:48,187
Hey. Hey, easy. Easy. Look
at me. We're almost there.

562
00:59:55,584 --> 00:59:56,607
Where's your ring?

563
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:00,494
I'm cleaning it.

564
01:00:06,005 --> 01:00:07,778
There's something
wrong about this place.

565
01:00:08,802 --> 01:00:10,456
We leave tomorrow. I promise.

566
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:48,508
Looking for this?

567
01:02:52,245 --> 01:02:54,148
It was your ring in Vince's bed, Rox.

568
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:55,922
No, Max. You don't
understand. I can explain.

569
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:56,887
He made me..

570
01:02:56,947 --> 01:02:58,700
.. you do what?

571
01:03:00,002 --> 01:03:02,962
Max, you were away for 3
years. And I had no one.

572
01:03:03,538 --> 01:03:05,982
And I made a mistake. Vince's
gonna tell you but.. I had..

573
01:03:10,285 --> 01:03:11,034
Max

574
01:03:21,004 --> 01:03:22,031
Can I come, Max?

575
01:03:31,121 --> 01:03:31,695
Where are you going, baby?

576
01:03:31,732 --> 01:03:32,709
To the meet.

577
01:03:32,746 --> 01:03:33,650
At 7 at night?

578
01:03:33,686 --> 01:03:34,479
I'll be early.

579
01:03:34,708 --> 01:03:36,213
You can't leave me alone!

580
01:04:07,117 --> 01:04:08,414
Does Roxanne know that
you're going to kill me?

581
01:05:40,108 --> 01:05:41,381
Stay right there, ma'am.

582
01:05:43,244 --> 01:05:44,073
How many of you?

583
01:05:46,371 --> 01:05:47,375
I asked you a question

584
01:05:47,952 --> 01:05:49,069
I'm alone

585
01:05:51,043 --> 01:05:52,529
Easy, ma'am.

586
01:05:58,394 --> 01:05:59,962
You found me, Mr Policeman.

587
01:06:00,779 --> 01:06:03,058
For a time, I don't
think that you would.

588
01:06:03,752 --> 01:06:04,928
Everything is going
to be alright, David.

589
01:06:05,945 --> 01:06:08,122
Our life are like stories, you know?

590
01:06:08,577 --> 01:06:12,471
There will be beginning,
a middle and the end.

591
01:06:14,478 --> 01:06:20,522
Max's story. Your stories
are here too, Mr Policeman.

592
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:25,381
Would you like to know how it ends?

593
01:06:47,364 --> 01:06:49,352
<i>Police Suspect Child Dead</i>

594
01:06:58,921 --> 01:07:01,397
Why haven't you told him about
the fallens in the basement?

595
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:03,288
Don't make things up.

596
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:06,169
There's nothing down there.

597
01:07:07,951 --> 01:07:09,563
Believe if you will.

598
01:07:39,095 --> 01:07:40,214
Not another step, lady.

599
01:07:47,925 --> 01:07:48,596
Open the door

600
01:07:50,023 --> 01:07:51,232
You're going for a long time.

601
01:07:55,581 --> 01:07:56,512
Open the door, lady.

602
01:07:59,056 --> 01:08:00,235
Better do something, Roxanne.

603
01:08:01,846 --> 01:08:02,947
Can't have babies in prison.

604
01:08:03,257 --> 01:08:04,642
This is your last
chance. Open the door.

605
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:06,241
Last chance!

606
01:08:44,113 --> 01:08:45,440
Get away. I killed that man.

607
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:47,668
Roxanne, you had no choice.

608
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:49,435
I did't want him die.

609
01:08:49,662 --> 01:08:50,717
Of course you didn't.

610
01:08:59,227 --> 01:09:00,263
It's gone.

611
01:09:03,637 --> 01:09:05,259
My whole life I had it.

612
01:09:12,638 --> 01:09:13,587
What are you, David?

613
01:09:15,258 --> 01:09:16,405
I'm an angel

614
01:09:21,238 --> 01:09:24,547
The voices in your dreams.
What did they tell you?

615
01:09:26,682 --> 01:09:29,288
They tell me to kill
Max but I would never-

616
01:09:29,728 --> 01:09:32,774
Their souls, Roxanne,
is going to hell.

617
01:09:34,446 --> 01:09:36,818
No, baby. Hell's not real.

618
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:41,237
It's something that the parents
frightened their children with. There's no-

619
01:09:42,086 --> 01:09:44,446
such place.

620
01:09:44,708 --> 01:09:46,369
Are you certain?

621
01:09:48,764 --> 01:09:50,330
I've seen it, Roxanne.

622
01:09:51,516 --> 01:09:53,832
The wicked, an eternal damnation

623
01:09:57,745 --> 01:10:00,267
God will punish Max
for his wickedness.

624
01:10:01,099 --> 01:10:02,045
Max isn't like that.

625
01:10:02,275 --> 01:10:04,919
Not yet. But he means to kill me.

626
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:06,984
The murder of an angel

627
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:08,261
No, he would never.

628
01:10:13,837 --> 01:10:16,221
Eternal damnation, Roxanne.

629
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:19,851
Please, David. I'll do anything.

630
01:10:21,104 --> 01:10:22,768
Would you kill for him?

631
01:10:23,613 --> 01:10:25,110
To save his soul?

632
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:30,520
Would you kill him for him?

633
01:10:49,752 --> 01:10:54,689
While you decide, you help me with the
fire. I'm too young to play with matches.

634
01:11:14,147 --> 01:11:15,965
Sam. Get away from there.

635
01:11:33,982 --> 01:11:36,395
Our business is nearly concluded.

636
01:11:37,534 --> 01:11:38,970
I know you're watching me.

637
01:11:39,735 --> 01:11:41,366
I'm not playing this game anymore.

638
01:11:41,801 --> 01:11:49,220
Good. This is a business to you. And you'll
aim your ammo bullet to the back of his head.

639
01:11:49,256 --> 01:11:50,857
That's not the deal I made.

640
01:11:52,773 --> 01:11:57,971
How dare you hang up on me? You
had a bad 4 days with David, Max?

641
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:02,027
Try 8 years?

642
01:12:08,637 --> 01:12:10,069
You're Jones?

643
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:15,337
There's enough here for more than
just a down payment, don't you think?

644
01:12:15,856 --> 01:12:17,918
I'm not gonna murder a little boy.

645
01:12:17,954 --> 01:12:19,981
That is the last it is.

646
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,365
Do you really think he's human?

647
01:12:30,985 --> 01:12:37,942
We have something in common you and I. We both let
the wolf in our home and lock the door behind it.

648
01:12:38,496 --> 01:12:41,427
When I adopted him, I've got
the life I've always wanted.

649
01:12:41,428 --> 01:12:44,973
But you've no idea
what he is capable of.

650
01:12:45,065 --> 01:12:47,620
Or all the ways he can get to you.

651
01:12:47,621 --> 01:12:49,498
I'll give up all I
have to get rid of him.

652
01:12:49,833 --> 01:12:54,693
He just get inside your head and
he whispers these horrible thoughts,

653
01:12:54,694 --> 01:12:58,552
and paints these
visions you can't escape.

654
01:12:58,630 --> 01:13:00,362
He is getting stronger, Max.

655
01:13:00,363 --> 01:13:06,515
And I have no idea what he could be
capable of in a year or a week or even now

656
01:13:06,516 --> 01:13:08,185
and he is not gonna stop.

657
01:13:08,287 --> 01:13:10,787
until all of us are dead.

658
01:13:11,289 --> 01:13:16,092
Who's watching him over right now? He killed
his own father. He killed his last nanny.

659
01:13:16,093 --> 01:13:18,596
Do you not think he's
going to kill her?

660
01:13:18,687 --> 01:13:25,091
Listen to me. I am begging
you. Please. Kill him.

661
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,664
You had the wrong guy.

662
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:30,294
No, please.

663
01:13:41,427 --> 01:13:42,527
I'm sorry.

664
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:53,577
I'm sorry.

665
01:14:11,578 --> 01:14:12,878
Come on. Come on. Come on.

666
01:14:19,279 --> 01:14:21,779
<i>I'm sorry. You have
reached the number...</i>

667
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:07,272
Shhh.. Do you hear it, Roxanne?

668
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:10,680
Hear what, baby?

669
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:14,192
Bad man coming.

670
01:15:44,638 --> 01:15:45,666
Rox?

671
01:15:49,885 --> 01:15:50,830
Rox!

672
01:15:52,397 --> 01:15:53,716
What are you gonna do to, David?

673
01:15:55,705 --> 01:15:56,653
Nothing.

674
01:16:00,413 --> 01:16:04,785
Max, say you forgive me.

675
01:16:06,425 --> 01:16:07,361
Of course I forgive you.

676
01:16:28,296 --> 01:16:29,424
Hide, David!

677
01:16:43,325 --> 01:16:44,025
<i>Get the gun, Max.</i>

678
01:16:45,126 --> 01:16:46,426
<i>Take the cop's gun.</i>

679
01:16:47,627 --> 01:16:48,227
<i>Run.</i>

680
01:17:06,761 --> 01:17:07,943
Put the gun down, Rox.

681
01:17:07,979 --> 01:17:10,129
We can get out of here and
leave all these behind us.

682
01:17:25,969 --> 01:17:26,758
You.

683
01:18:27,248 --> 01:18:27,999
David!

684
01:18:28,246 --> 01:18:29,071
No!

685
01:18:34,849 --> 01:18:35,337
Max!

686
01:18:37,233 --> 01:18:38,359
For your soul, Max!

687
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:28,944
David, come to me!

688
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:30,340
Get out of here, Rox!

689
01:19:49,041 --> 01:19:49,241
<i>Over here.</i>

690
01:19:49,942 --> 01:19:50,642
<i>Come and get me.</i>

691
01:19:51,443 --> 01:19:52,143
<i>Look</i>

692
01:19:52,744 --> 01:19:53,544
<i>Hey, Max.</i>

693
01:19:55,445 --> 01:19:55,845
<i>Behind you.</i>

694
01:20:10,918 --> 01:20:12,358
Nice shot, Max.

695
01:20:23,658 --> 01:20:25,158
Oh God, Rox.

696
01:20:30,529 --> 01:20:31,452
You can't leave me.

697
01:20:31,685 --> 01:20:33,662
Don't-

698
01:20:33,699 --> 01:20:35,640
Rox, I'm sorry.

699
01:20:41,807 --> 01:20:42,542
Rox!

700
01:20:44,711 --> 01:20:46,695
Oh, no!

701
01:20:47,763 --> 01:20:48,522
Rox!

702
01:20:59,324 --> 01:21:00,613
No, no, no.

703
01:21:02,519 --> 01:21:04,326
I'm just getting started here.

704
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:09,885
Poor Roxanne. She
thought I was an angel.

705
01:21:10,886 --> 01:21:12,269
You can't kill an angel.

706
01:21:15,310 --> 01:21:16,409
Demon, maybe.

707
01:21:17,007 --> 01:21:19,698
Ah... What's a demon?
One of the angel who fell.

708
01:21:20,172 --> 01:21:22,272
Like you're gonna fall, Max.

709
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:25,257
Don't look so sad, killer.

710
01:21:25,258 --> 01:21:30,472
You're on a winning team now.
No commandments. No guilt.

711
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,199
I was sent for those
that are desperate.

712
01:21:40,115 --> 01:21:41,810
I come to them when they are weak.

713
01:21:42,967 --> 01:21:44,484
When their lives are hopeless.

714
01:21:45,433 --> 01:21:47,270
When those they love reject them.

715
01:21:50,644 --> 01:21:59,642
I come to them. Whisper into their
ear and I can be very convincing.

716
01:22:05,215 --> 01:22:06,569
Why, David?

717
01:22:08,210 --> 01:22:09,572
Why all this?

718
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:11,608
Casting for souls, Max.

719
01:22:11,818 --> 01:22:13,102
That's what I do.

720
01:22:14,032 --> 01:22:15,022
And me?

721
01:22:16,526 --> 01:22:17,797
What do I do?

722
01:22:18,023 --> 01:22:20,719
You're as weak as the rest of them.

723
01:22:20,756 --> 01:22:23,416
So be a good boy and
put the gun to your head.

724
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:30,413
Do it.

725
01:22:30,820 --> 01:22:33,797
Or hear my voice every
moment for your life.

726
01:22:45,997 --> 01:22:47,636
It was a good game, Max.

727
01:25:01,598 --> 01:25:04,660
Good game, Max. But it's not over.

728
01:25:10,641 --> 01:25:12,766
Yeah, David. It is.

729
01:25:21,748 --> 01:25:22,597
Rox?

730
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:24,761
You can't kill an angel, Max.

731
01:25:38,565 --> 01:25:39,853
They will always be with you, Max.

732
01:25:41,101 --> 01:25:42,070
Always.

733
01:26:52,047 --> 01:26:54,147
Ho! Ho! Ho!

734
01:26:54,648 --> 01:26:56,409
Merry Christmas!

735
01:26:58,600 --> 01:27:00,711
Bless you... Merry Christmas.

736
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:07,711
