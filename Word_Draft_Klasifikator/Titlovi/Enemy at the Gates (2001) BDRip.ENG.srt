2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,340
I am a stone.

3
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,260
I do not move.

4
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,940
Very slowly, I put snow in my mouth,

5
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:56,070
then he won't see my breath.

6
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:09,090
I take my time. I
let him come closer.

7
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,960
I have only one bullet.
I aim at his eye.

8
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:18,370
Very gently, my finger
presses on the trigger.

9
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,340
I do not tremble.

10
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,850
I have no fear. I'm a big boy now.

11
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:38,960
Ready, Vassili?

12
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,820
Now, Vassili. Fire!

13
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:45,060
Fire, Vassili! Fire!

14
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,060
Come on, pick your feet up.

15
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,560
Get on your feet. Prepare
to board the train.

16
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:02,030
You there, come along
with me now. This way, pal.

17
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,710
All civilians, get out!

18
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,270
Make way, let the civilians off.

19
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,650
This is a military convoy.

20
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:17,390
No one stays on board
but our valiant soldiers.

21
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,050
This is a convoy to Stalingrad...

22
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,620
only for the soldiers
of the Red Army.

23
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:47,280
All aboard!

24
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:15,410
Autumn, 1942.

25
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,980
Europe lies crushed
beneath the Nazi jackboot.

26
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,720
The German Third Reich I
sat the height of its power.

27
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,160
Hitler's armies are charging through
the heart of the Soviet Union...

28
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,720
towards the oilfields of Asia.

29
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,330
One last obstacle remains.
A city on the Volga...

30
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,540
where the fate of the world
is being decided. Stalingrad.

31
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,630
Glorious comrade Stalin...

32
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,530
has ordered not
another step backwards.

33
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,800
The people of the Soviet
Union shall be free.

34
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:58,210
Go forward, comrades.
Not a step backwards!

35
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,240
Listen to these letters
sent by Russian mothers...

36
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:22,440
to their sons on the front.

37
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:27,680
"Volodya, my child, I know
that it's for our motherland-

38
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:36,690
"I know that it's for our motherland
that you are giving your life.

39
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,510
"Everyone here knows that
you will not fall back.

40
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,640
"Everyone here is proud of you.

41
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,350
"Your father is dead.
Your brothers are dead.

42
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,950
Avenge us on the hordes of fascists."

43
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,200
Nobody move! Stay on the boat!

44
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,410
Get back or I'll shoot!

45
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:54,870
Back from the rails, or we
shoot. Shoot the traitors!

46
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,080
Come on, come on! Move!

47
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,450
Come on, comrades, come on!

48
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,460
Move, or you'll be shot!

49
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,980
Over here, stretcher!

50
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,380
The one with the rifle shoots!

51
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,110
One out of two gets a rifle.

52
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,560
The one without follows him!

53
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:18,260
When the one with
the rifle gets killed,

54
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:23,100
the one who is following
picks up the rifle and shoots!

55
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:28,400
The one with the rifle shoots!

56
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,840
The one without follows him!

57
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,610
When the one with
the rifle gets killed,

58
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,170
the one who is following...

59
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:41,280
picks up the rifle and shoots!

60
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,340
The one with the rifle shoots!

61
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:48,420
This way, now. The one
without follows him!

62
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,640
Soldiers of the glorious
Red Army, from now on...

63
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,120
it is either victory or death!

64
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,220
Those who retreat will
be shot. I need a rifle.

65
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,890
There will be no mercy
For cowards and traitors!

66
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,060
Achtung!

67
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,320
Aah!

68
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,080
It's hopeless, comrades. Get back!

69
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,780
Pullback!

70
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,650
Pullback!

71
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,590
Get back! Get back!

72
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,650
In the name of the Soviet Union,

73
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:36,530
not a step backwards, or we shoot.

74
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,860
No retreat! Not a step back!

75
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,930
No mercy! Deserters will be shot.

76
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,670
Fire! Shoot the traitors!

77
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:49,370
Cowards will be shot!

78
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,780
No mercy for cowards!

79
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,660
Russians, surrender. You
will see your home again.

80
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,420
This is not your war.

81
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,930
Join your German comrades, They
understand your suffering...

82
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,900
and will care more for
you than your own officers,

83
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,270
who are only sending
you to your death.

84
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,830
The Third Reich Is not your enemy.

85
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,510
The enemy is blood thirsty
Stalin And his Bolshevik camp,

86
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:00,240
who have stolen your land,
who have deported your father-

87
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,770
Fire!

88
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:27,090
You'll get us caught,
comrade Commissar.

89
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,350
With your permission,
comrade Commissar.

90
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,420
Which one should I aim at
first? You should wait...

91
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,490
till there's an explosion.

92
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:46,010
Do you know how to shoot? A little.

93
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,990
Don't shoot. Don't
shoot. He's looking at us.

94
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,970
Thank you, comrade Commissar.

95
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,580
Danilov, political
officer, second class.

96
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:03,600
Twenty-first infantry.

97
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,340
"Vassili Zaitsev."

98
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,720
"On this day, September
the 20th, 1942,

99
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:31,490
"a shepherd boy from the Urals...

100
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,360
"arrived in the city of Stalingrad,
on the banks of the Volga.

101
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:41,270
"His name is Vassili Zaitsev.

102
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,100
"Like thousands before him, he came
to answer comrade Stalin's call.

103
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,710
"Armed with a rifle, he quickly made
the fascist invader realize that...

104
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,910
"from now on he would be punished for
every step he took in the motherland;

105
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,320
that from here on,
the only way was back."

106
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,290
What do you think?

107
00:22:07,930 --> 00:22:11,130
I think comrade Commissar's
been overgenerous.

108
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:32,310
Let me go! Let me go!

109
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,860
By order of comrade Stalin,
no civilian can leave the city.

110
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,830
Get back!

111
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,340
Stand away, or we will open fire.

112
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,450
Stand away!

113
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,510
Get back!

114
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,460
Get back or we shoot!

115
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,190
Back! Keep back!

116
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:13,720
Make way for comrade Stalin 's envoy!

117
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,600
I carried out my orders.

118
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,940
I sent in all of my boys.

119
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:27,570
But the Germans engulfed us.

120
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,810
They have artillery, aircraft, tanks.

121
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:36,050
And me, what did I have?
The sacred duty to resist!

122
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,590
I have to report to the boss.

123
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:43,850
Perhaps you'd prefer
to avoid the red tape.

124
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,450
My name is...

125
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,190
Nikita Sergeyevich Kruschev.

126
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:18,290
I've come to take
things in hand here.

127
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:22,360
This city is not Kursk...

128
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,270
nor is it Kiev, nor Minsk.

129
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,900
This city is Stalingrad.

130
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,710
Stalingrad!

131
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,940
This city bears the name of the boss.

132
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,610
It's more than a city, it's a symbol.

133
00:24:39,690 --> 00:24:44,920
If the Germans capture this city,

134
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:49,450
the entire country will collapse.

135
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,690
Now, I want our boys...

136
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:56,400
to raise their heads.

137
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,130
I want them to act
like they have balls!

138
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:04,370
I want them to stop
shitting their pants!

139
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:11,320
That's your job.

140
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:16,720
As political officers,
I'm counting on you.

141
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:23,260
You, what's your suggestion?

142
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:25,770
Shoot all the other generals
who have retreated...

143
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,030
and their chiefs of staff too.

144
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,940
M-Make some examples.

145
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:36,270
D-D-Deport families of the
deserters- Yeah, that's all been done.

146
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:38,710
Give them hope!

147
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:54,660
Here, the men's only choice is
between German bullets and ours.

148
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,820
But there's another
way. The way of courage.

149
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,330
The way of love of the motherland.

150
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,340
We must publish the
army newspaper again.

151
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,500
We must tell magnificent
stories. Stories that extol...

152
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,560
sacrifice, bravery.

153
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,910
We must make them
believe in the victory.

154
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,000
We must give them hope,
pride, a desire to fight.

155
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:17,180
Yes, we need to make examples.

156
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,380
But examples to follow.

157
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,320
What we need... are heroes.

158
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,720
Do you know any heroes around here?

159
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:36,260
Yes, comrade, I know one.

160
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,170
That's me!

161
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,210
"Vassili Zaitsev." That's me!

162
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:50,340
No, you're not
dreaming. It's your name.

163
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,180
We made the front page.

164
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,520
They haven't changed a word.

165
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,000
Do you have any idea what this means?

166
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,620
It's not the back page,
it's not the second page,

167
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,960
it's the front page. The front page!

168
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,440
They're going to reprint
our article everywhere.

169
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,500
In the Caucasus, in the
Crimea, even in the Urals.

170
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,940
Tomorrow morning, Stalin himself
will be sitting over breakfast,

171
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:18,740
reading my words,
memorizing your name.

172
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,510
We're famous, Vassili.
Kruschev loved the article.

173
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:23,640
He's promoted me to
the general staff.

174
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,210
And you to sniper division.

175
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,330
Well, that's good. It's very good.

176
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,590
It's very good. It's
great. It's very great!

177
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,900
It's great! For us
because we did it together.

178
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,460
Together!

179
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,590
Although I did all the
hard work. oh, yeah?

180
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,000
You're very lucky I can't
fight back. Why's that?

181
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,410
Because Kruschev told me to
make sure nothing happens to you.

182
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,470
You're too important.
I'm too valuable.

183
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,070
Yes, careful of my...  careful of
my glasses, please. They're new.

184
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,140
Sorry, sir.

185
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,750
I'm famous! We're famous!
I'm famous! I'm famous!

186
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:59,380
Vassili, the young
shepherd from the Urals,

187
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,390
killed his 12th German officer today.

188
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,450
He used to hunt wolves,
Now he shoots fascists.

189
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,660
Today, Vassili Zaitsev shot
his 23rd German officer.

190
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:08,720
He is an example to us all.

191
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,360
Vassili shot his 32ndGerman officer.

192
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:18,080
Count only the Germans
you have killed.

193
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,140
Today, Vassili Zaitsev-
Here is the evidence-

194
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,870
11 dog tags retrieved by
sniper Vassili Zaitsev.

195
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:31,680
More and more men and women, fighters
from all branches of our armed forces,

196
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,190
join the sniper division and learn
the skills of Vassili Zaitsev.

197
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,290
I am a stone.

198
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:48,430
I am a stone.

199
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,530
I breathe slowly.

200
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:02,420
I aim at the eye.

201
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:33,780
So it is you,

202
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:37,520
the great Vassili Zaitsev.

203
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,080
My mother makes potatoes
with bacon. Sounds good.

204
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,650
When she sees you, she
won't believe her eyes.

205
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:49,970
How many today? Only two.

206
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,870
And the last one, why
didn't you shoot him?

207
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:57,640
He was only a foot soldier. Wasn't
worth giving away my position.

208
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:01,960
Bless you.

209
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:03,920
We know how much we owe you.

210
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:07,490
We pray for you every day.

211
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,370
Every evening, we listen to them
talk about you on Radio Moscow.

212
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,130
Thanks. You've certainly
managed well down here.

213
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,840
My parents used to store
furniture down here before the war.

214
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:23,570
Sacha, drop that right now.

215
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:26,640
It's loaded.

216
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,030
This way, comrade Commissar.

217
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,090
Thank you, comrade.

218
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,230
Good evening.

219
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,190
Comrade Zaitsev?

220
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,370
My God, where does all
this mail come from?

221
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:01,510
From all over the country,
Mrs. Filipov, from all over.

222
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,650
This one's from the
workers of the Kouzbass.

223
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,710
They want to name their
mine after Vassili.

224
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,780
Right, let's start with the miners.

225
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,790
Come on, let's get to work.

226
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:19,730
Dear comrades from the Kouzbass,

227
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Kouzbass. I thank you
for your letter of praise.

228
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:26,710
Praise?
R-A-I-S-E.

229
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,580
And... I hope that I can live up...

230
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:39,590
to your expectations
A-T-I-O-N-S.

231
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:43,390
Expectations.

232
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,260
You're interested in German
literature, Mrs. Filipov?

233
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,370
It's all right, it's our neighbor.

234
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,000
Right, where were we?
Tania, we have guests.

235
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:57,910
Your offer to name-

236
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,950
I...

237
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,950
I-I recognize you.

238
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,690
He's Vassili Zaitsev.

239
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,760
I saw your picture in the paper.

240
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,860
Thank you For
everything you're doing.

241
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,630
And this is his friend,
Commissar... Danilov.

242
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,840
Danilov.

243
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,000
Tania is like a daughter to me.

244
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,410
She used to take care of Sacha
when I worked at the factory.

245
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,640
She even taught him German.
All these books are hers.

246
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:41,350
Oh, they're yours? She studied
German at the university.

247
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:43,720
Which university? Moscow.

248
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,300
Moscow. Moscow.

249
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,560
Shouldn't we, uh-

250
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,900
Yes, let's continue.

251
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,410
Your offer to name
Your mine after me...

252
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,140
is... a great honor.

253
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,950
Yes, I know. Honor.

254
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,720
Very good.

255
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:24,230
Shouldn't we make the point that
I'm not the only one fighting?

256
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,290
That...That's
excellent...excellent idea, Vassili.

257
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,430
We can take it even
further though. Oh.

258
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,440
We can take it further.

259
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:36,570
Your battle for The
production of coal...

260
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:40,240
is as worthy as mine.

261
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,150
There's no "K" in coal.

262
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,210
Just-just one "L."

263
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,660
Oh, tell me if I'm going too fast.

264
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,490
No, you're not going
too fast. You sure?

265
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,660
I just thought is there
Any other improvements?

266
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:02,230
Why don't you get some rest? These
letters can wait until tomorrow.

267
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,740
We should carry on. We're not tired.

268
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,970
Thank you, Mrs.
Filipov. These people...

269
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,910
took the trouble to write to us.

270
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:14,310
Tomorrow, we may not
be around to write back.

271
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,780
Major Konig, Herr General.

272
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:51,940
I was expecting someone...

273
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,950
else.

274
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,890
Certainly not someone so prestigious.

275
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,950
I imagine you have your reasons...

276
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,860
for getting yourself involved
in this hellish situation.

277
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,900
My army is not designed
For this kind of fighting.

278
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:12,200
Yesterday, yet again,
I had to promote...

279
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:16,760
25 sergeants to replace the officers
shot down by their sharpshooters.

280
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:22,410
Those snipers are
demoralizing my people.

281
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,820
This city is no more than...

282
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,910
a heap of ruins.

283
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,150
But the fuehrer's persisting.

284
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,420
He has made it a personal matter
between Stalin and himself.

285
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,270
We should trust the
fuehrer's instinct.

286
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,970
He always managed to
lead us to victory.

287
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,680
We shall be back home For Christmas.

288
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:03,350
How are you going to go about
finding this young Russian?

289
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:09,360
I'll fix it so that he's
the one who finds me.

290
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:13,430
Vassili. Vassili.

291
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,590
Come on, time to get up. What?

292
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,470
They have a problem in the department
store sector. They need us. Come on.

293
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:33,750
Look, Vassili, he's hiding in
the department store. Over there.

294
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,690
So far this morning,

295
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,100
he's knocked off five officers,
plus two machine gunners.

296
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:52,170
Look, third floor, fourth
window from the left.

297
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,970
Fourth window from the left.

298
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,680
See him?

299
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,410
Yeah, I see him.

300
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,860
There, you got him!

301
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:20,770
Great shot.

302
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:26,070
Let's go get his dog tag.

303
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,110
Good-bye, comrade Commissar.

304
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,840
Thank you for your
hospitality, Mrs. Filipov.

305
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,120
You can borrow whatever you like.

306
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,890
I'm not sure what they would
say to me at headquarters...

307
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,900
if I came back with an
armful of Goethe and Schiller.

308
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,030
There's some Marx too.

309
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,800
You were assigned to civil
defense at the 12th district?

310
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:00,100
No, I volunteered.

311
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,410
It's such a coincidence
meeting you like this.

312
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,470
Comrade Kruschev was
telling me just yesterday...

313
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:07,950
how desperately we're in need
of operators who speak German.

314
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,820
I can't. Our militia's responsible for
all the people in this neighbourhood.

315
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,880
We're already
desperately short of men.

316
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,950
We'll give you a dozen soldiers
for every one that speaks German.

317
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,960
I'd rather stay and fight.

318
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,160
Serving at headquarters is fighting.
You'd be far more useful there.

319
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,700
You stay here. You cover us.

320
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,930
All right. We go.

321
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,640
Take care.

322
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,180
Ludmilla, come on.

323
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,210
Check the stairway.

324
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,030
It's a trap.

325
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,430
I know.

326
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,760
Move back.

327
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:43,010
He's still here.

328
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,400
They're coming straight
for us! Ludmilla,

329
00:44:10,470 --> 00:44:14,240
stay where you are, he's
over there somewhere.

330
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:27,550
We have to get out of here!

331
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,990
We have to get out of here!
Just stay where you are!

332
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,600
What are we gonna do?

333
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,070
Ludmilla, stay where you are!

334
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:55,710
Fuck this, I'm going.

335
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:00,710
Ludmilla, no!

336
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:53,840
What does this mean?

337
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:59,340
"The little shepherd from the
Urals receives a new sniper's rifle,

338
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:05,190
"a Mosin-Nagant 7.62, with
its 3.5-Power P. U. Telescope.

339
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,250
Pride of precision
of Soviet production."

340
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:10,690
I've seen that rifle
close up. Have you?

341
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:15,500
I've even touched it. I know
him well, Vassili Zaitsev.

342
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,580
Ludmilla and Anton were killed
today, and it was my fault.

343
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:12,090
No, I'm sure that's not true.

344
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,530
There was a German sniper. I
walked them right into his trap.

345
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:21,000
What else can you tell
me? He didn't relocate.

346
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:25,900
A sniper who doesn't
relocate isn't normal.

347
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:33,450
He was very good. It wasn't just
his shooting, it was his instinct.

348
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:36,170
He was a step ahead
of me all the time.

349
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:40,380
That's because he knows
everything about you.

350
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:43,350
His name is Konig, Major Konig.

351
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:48,090
They've sent him here to ki-

352
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,290
to find you.

353
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,440
At first we weren't sure if
the information was reliable.

354
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,530
It seems he's come all the
way from Berlin to stop you.

355
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:07,070
You've caused them so many sleepless
nights, they sent their top marksman.

356
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:11,140
What do we know about him?
He's a major in the Wehrmacht.

357
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:15,210
He's director of their
sniper school in Zossen.

358
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:18,780
Koulikov studied under him
at Zossen before the war.

359
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:23,230
He knows all his tricks. From now
on, he'll go with you everywhere.

360
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,730
A nobleman from Bavaria
who hunts deer...

361
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,000
against a shepherd boy from
the Urals who poaches wolves.

362
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,010
It's more than a confrontation
between two nations.

363
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,640
It's the essence of class struggle.

364
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:42,380
I'm glad you're so happy.

365
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,620
He had all the advantages.
Next time you'll be even.

366
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,420
No one shoots like you, Vassili.

367
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:02,330
She's been transferred.

368
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,900
I'll see if they're
ready for you next door.

369
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,940
Hello. You look smart
in your new uniform.

370
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:18,410
Make sure they don't take
it back once you've finished.

371
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:20,820
Yeah, they probably will.

372
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:29,000
I've heard the rumor about the
German, and I wanted to wish you luck.

373
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,620
Thank you. I'll need it.

374
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,360
From what comrade Danilov
tells me, you're going to win.

375
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:41,170
Hmm.

376
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:43,370
It's time.

377
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,020
Vassili! Vassili! Come to my arms.

378
00:49:50,390 --> 00:49:54,320
Look in my direction.

379
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:56,650
Put your cap back on,
you look more heroic.

380
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,560
This way, comrade Zaitsev.
I love this little fellow.

381
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:03,150
Vassili, is it true that you
volunteered for the front?

382
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:04,180
How old are you, Vassili?

383
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,240
Do you know what this
duel means for our country?

384
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,220
Is it true you killed your
first wolf when you were five?

385
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:12,990
Are you proud to be challenged By
the best sharpshooter in Germany?

386
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,050
The Germans are starting
to shit their pants.

387
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,330
Go on, my boy, tell us how
you're going to deal with him.

388
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,860
Or rather, no. Tell it to the
boss. One more question, please.

389
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,100
He likes good hunting stories.

390
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,810
Look at him with pride,

391
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,650
because he's looking at you.

392
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,520
The whole country is looking at you.

393
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:06,440
Forgive me, forgive me, Grandfather.

394
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,440
So, it's not the wolf that
chooses the hunting ground...

395
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,820
but the hunter.

396
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:50,520
But I'm sure your
grandfather taught you that.

397
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,930
Except in this case,

398
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,940
I'm the game.

399
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,170
However, today what
we're going to do...

400
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,640
is lure the wolf out of his lair...

401
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:11,810
to where we want him to be.

402
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:54,060
You're the one whose life
is valuable. You go first.

403
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:58,830
No, no. We take it in turns. Next
time is your turn to go first,

404
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,870
and then it's you, Volodya.

405
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,180
Son of a bitch!

406
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,720
These are new pants. I just took them
off a captain from the 251st yesterday.

407
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:36,090
Sixteen months I spent in
Germany at the school in Zossen.

408
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:40,070
Of course, those were the days when
we were friends with the Krauts,:

409
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:43,580
When our Joseph and their Adolph...

410
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,700
were walking hand in hand.

411
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:51,380
From here to the
wire, 160meters, right?

412
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,150
One hundred and fifty-five.

413
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:03,930
Whatever. That'll make
'em Send out a repair guy.

414
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,300
Let's relocate.

415
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:15,740
Aah!

416
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,120
Hey, Volodya!

417
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:41,630
After the Germans invaded us,

418
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:45,730
it wasn't the same
atmosphere anymore.

419
00:54:45,810 --> 00:54:48,370
Threw my ass in prison.

420
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,210
What were you doing in Germany, huh?

421
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,940
Excuse me, says I, but it was
comrade Stalin who sent me there.

422
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:00,720
Don't bring our glorious
leader into your treachery.

423
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:04,230
Confess, spy bastard! Confess.

424
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:08,290
And bang! Bang, bang, bang!

425
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:14,360
Well, there wasn't a sickle,
but there was a hammer.

426
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:18,930
And bang. Knocked out all my teeth.

427
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,470
That's right, boy. Have no illusions.

428
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:28,880
That's the land of socialism
and universal bliss for you.

429
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,890
Hey! It's your repair guy.

430
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,450
I got him.

431
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,210
It's about soup time, isn't it?

432
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:58,110
I'm going.

433
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:01,010
Well, get a move on, Volodya,

434
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:06,700
and try not to spill it all on
your way back, you Marxist bastard.

435
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,640
The enemy sniper activity reported
during the past 24 hours, Herr Major.

436
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,850
Two sentries shot in
the train station sector.

437
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:31,860
One artillery observer
in the Northern sector.

438
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,290
One lieutenant from the 24th Panzer
division in the factory sector.

439
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:38,890
Three telephone repairmen in
the workers' housing sector.

440
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:43,260
They also tell me we have just taken
a prisoner who may interest you.

441
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:45,270
I hope he's still able to speak.

442
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,970
Excuse me, sir?

443
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:50,530
Nothing. Thank you.

444
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,840
So, tell us, Volodya,

445
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,040
which building is he in?

446
00:57:00,810 --> 00:57:02,750
There is no way I know that.

447
00:57:05,150 --> 00:57:07,180
He moves around all the time.

448
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,190
He jumps from one to the next.

449
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,190
On which floor?

450
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:14,190
I don't know.

451
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:17,390
We'll see about that.

452
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:19,930
Undress him.

453
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,470
Put him in one of our uniforms.

454
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,130
You see, they are stubborn.

455
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,400
That's the good thing
about the Germans.

456
00:57:56,470 --> 00:58:00,810
Man, you got to admit when
they get an idea in their heads-

457
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:18,850
Right.

458
00:58:18,930 --> 00:58:21,360
Let's see if our
customer has arrived.

459
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:23,960
Are you ready?

460
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,970
Uh-huh.

461
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:30,270
And now our famous
shepherd from the Urals,

462
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,640
who Major Konig thinks is an idiot,

463
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,680
gets up to make sure
he has hit his target.

464
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:38,540
Major Konig sees him.

465
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:44,850
Aims for his helmet.

466
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,480
Fires.

467
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:50,860
Reveals his position
And is shot in turn.

468
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:06,040
Except... Major Konig doesn't fire...

469
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,410
because Major Konig isn't there.

470
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,320
Koulikov!

471
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,660
Don't you think that was
strange, that last one?

472
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,860
They sent him out to
get shot like the others.

473
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:32,870
It's not natural.

474
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,400
Not without artillery,
without trying to cover him.

475
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,670
Oh, no, I'm the one who was stupid.

476
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,980
They don't give a shit
about telephone guys.

477
00:59:44,050 --> 00:59:45,980
I mean, it's like us
with the Ukrainians.

478
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:49,540
They'd never bother a major
over a few dead grunts.

479
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:55,420
Tomorrow, we'll kill
us some generals.

480
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,630
Whose turn is it?

481
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:09,540
Mine, I think.

482
01:00:09,610 --> 01:00:11,870
Oh, you're such a cheater!

483
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,370
You can't fool Papa Koulikov.

484
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:19,300
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
it's my turn to go first.

485
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,530
And it's your turn to get
a hole in your britches.

486
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:42,650
To victory.

487
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:54,790
This sniper business has
been dragging on too long.

488
01:01:54,860 --> 01:01:57,130
What's that little
fellow of yours up to?

489
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,470
He's probing, comrade Kruschev.

490
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,010
He's testing the
Germans for weaknesses.

491
01:02:05,070 --> 01:02:07,010
He's meticulous in his preparation.

492
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:14,350
Vodka... is a luxury we have.

493
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:17,820
Caviar is a luxury we have.

494
01:02:17,890 --> 01:02:20,750
Time is not.

495
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,790
He's aware of that comrade
Kruschev. We both are.

496
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,290
I assure you he will succeed.

497
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:30,420
Good.

498
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:34,730
It seems your destinies are entwined.

499
01:02:56,520 --> 01:02:58,460
They're keeping you busy.

500
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,390
I picked this up in the kitchen.

501
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:09,200
It's from the reception the other day.
I thought Mrs. Filipov might like it.

502
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:13,210
Um, she will be thrilled.
That's very sweet of you.

503
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,540
There's plenty more if you're hungry.

504
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:20,410
You'e Jewish, aren't you?

505
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,850
There's nothing in our religion
that says you can't eat sturgeon.

506
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:29,410
My father had a premonition
all this would happen.

507
01:03:29,490 --> 01:03:31,650
You mean the war?

508
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:35,720
He understood that the
hatred of the jews ran deep.

509
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:40,030
He was saving up to buy
some land in Palestine.

510
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:44,330
He said it was the only
land we truly belonged in;

511
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:47,270
the only land we
had a duty to defend.

512
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:51,440
He insisted learn to use a rifle.

513
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:53,780
I learned to shoot.

514
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:03,480
I know that in times of war, personal
feelings should be put aside, but...

515
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,620
I have a favor to ask you.

516
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:07,960
Of course. Anything you want.

517
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:11,190
I want to be reassigned.

518
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:15,930
What's happened, Tania?

519
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,530
He shot him.

520
01:04:46,370 --> 01:04:48,840
He shot him even
though he jumped first.

521
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:52,770
Shot him on the run.

522
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,110
It was an impossible shot.

523
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,480
I've never seen anything like it.

524
01:04:57,550 --> 01:05:00,980
You've promised people a
victory I can't deliver.

525
01:05:03,050 --> 01:05:05,820
I don't stand a chance
against this man.

526
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:07,980
You mustn't talk like that, Vassili.

527
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:13,290
What if I told you we found
a way to track his movements?

528
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:15,490
We've got someone, Vassili.

529
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,800
Someone close to him
passing us information.

530
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:21,930
Next time you will be
one step ahead of him.

531
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:25,580
I promise.

532
01:05:35,050 --> 01:05:38,650
Now I have a favor to ask.

533
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,660
From me?

534
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,500
It's about Tania.

535
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:52,900
Come in.

536
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:59,970
He doesn't even know you exist.

537
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:03,810
But at that moment, you are closer
to him than anyone else on earth.

538
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:07,050
You see his face through the sight.

539
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:09,480
You see whether he shaved
that morning or not.

540
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:13,320
You can see whether he's married
by whether he has a wedding ring on.

541
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:17,960
It's not like...

542
01:06:18,030 --> 01:06:21,260
just firing at a distant
shape, not just a uniform.

543
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:24,400
It's a man's face.

544
01:06:24,470 --> 01:06:28,200
Those faces don't go away.

545
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:33,440
They come back and they just
- they get replaced by more faces.

546
01:06:33,510 --> 01:06:36,710
Did Danilov ask you to tell me this?

547
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:40,550
He likes you very much. I think he'd
try anything to change your mind.

548
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:43,380
Did he tell you why I
asked for the transfer?

549
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:45,390
No.

550
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,390
This morning, a list
arrived at headquarters.

551
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,090
It was a list of
civilians who'd been...

552
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:53,630
rounded up and sent to
Germany in a convoy...

553
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,260
that left Stalingrad three weeks ago.

554
01:06:57,940 --> 01:07:00,270
My parents were amongst them.

555
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:06,710
After 30 kilometers,
the German soldiers...

556
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:10,910
stopped the train and
forced everyone out.

557
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:17,220
In the middle of a bridge,
they bound them together,

558
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:20,190
two by two.

559
01:07:20,260 --> 01:07:22,890
Mothers with daughters.

560
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:24,900
Husbands and wives.

561
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:31,030
They... lined them up
against the railing,

562
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:34,440
and then they fired a
single shot at each pair...

563
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,440
to save bullets.

564
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,280
It worked.

565
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:44,950
The bodies of the ones who died
dragged the others under the water.

566
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:50,490
I know they died together.

567
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,660
They never would have let
themselves be separated.

568
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:13,680
That's Koulikov's rifle.
It's a good... rifle.

569
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:24,850
Thank you.

570
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,920
I know how he leaves the shelter.

571
01:08:56,990 --> 01:08:58,930
He goes through the tractor factory.

572
01:08:58,990 --> 01:09:02,230
The tractor factory is big.

573
01:09:04,930 --> 01:09:07,630
I know exactly where. He
crawls through a gutter,

574
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:10,610
under a grate where the vats are,

575
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,700
then he goes out from the workshop.

576
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:16,010
In between the two, there's a
place where he's in the open.

577
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,950
It's under a long, iron foot walk.

578
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,940
Good luck, comrade.

579
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,750
I know exactly where
he's waiting for me.

580
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:48,720
He'll be on the foot
walk over the gutter.

581
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:51,290
We'll take him out from behind.

582
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:16,490
We'll get to the other end of
the workshop through these pipes.

583
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,490
Follow me.

584
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:07,160
You go that way. I'll
go around this way.

585
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:10,040
Okay?

586
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:27,720
Shit!

587
01:14:35,100 --> 01:14:38,540
Sergei, you should go back.

588
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:41,830
No, I'll be all right. Go back.

589
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,270
No, you go!

590
01:14:48,850 --> 01:14:50,780
Keep your legs in.

591
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:38,500
Come on. Come on. Come on.

592
01:16:37,030 --> 01:16:40,550
Comrade Stalin is asking
for one last effort!

593
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:42,660
The fate of the
motherland is at risk!

594
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,330
The fate of all those
you love and cherish!

595
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,800
It's for them that we fight today.

596
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:53,630
Listen to me, Tania. The Germans
are throwing everything at us.

597
01:16:53,710 --> 01:16:56,650
If they're lucky, one in ten of
these soldiers will come back alive.

598
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:59,710
You're highly educated.
You know languages.

599
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:03,180
Every intercept you translate
saves hundreds of lives.

600
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:07,090
Every message you decode
kills thousands of theirs.

601
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,250
You have a duty to survive.

602
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:11,890
Vassili was born to fire
a gun. It's what he knows.

603
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:15,660
You and I were born
for a different purpose.

604
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:18,570
If Vassili were here, he
would tell you the same thing.

605
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:26,330
Where is he? Where is Vassili?

606
01:18:32,210 --> 01:18:34,270
Keep your head down.

607
01:18:34,350 --> 01:18:36,980
Tell me where he is. Stay
into that pipe, Tania.

608
01:18:37,050 --> 01:18:39,070
Stay in. Stay in! Get your head in!

609
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,090
Slow down.

610
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:51,100
Don't shoot.

611
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:57,870
He's over there.

612
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:14,350
Do you see the pillar
in front of you?

613
01:19:16,230 --> 01:19:18,690
I need you to move round behind it.

614
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,500
Go.

615
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:37,580
Tania, I need you to find
a large piece of glass.

616
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:40,840
Piece of glass.

617
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:46,320
Do you see the kiln...

618
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:50,120
behind me to the left of the factory?

619
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,360
Yes? I can't hear you.

620
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:57,560
Yes. Yes.

621
01:19:57,630 --> 01:19:59,900
Do you see...

622
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:03,000
the two louvers?

623
01:20:04,310 --> 01:20:07,170
Yes. Do you see the one...

624
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:10,010
with a broken slat?

625
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:11,930
Yes.

626
01:20:12,060 --> 01:20:14,120
This is what I want you to do.

627
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:24,340
Are you ready? Yes.

628
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:28,640
Three... two... one...

629
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,390
Hello, Sacha.

630
01:20:55,540 --> 01:20:57,600
He was right where you said he'd be.

631
01:20:59,150 --> 01:21:01,080
Nearly there.

632
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,250
He's very clever.

633
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,520
Tell me about him.

634
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:24,570
Why was it his grandfather taught
him how to shoot and not his father?

635
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:28,230
His father's dead. His mother too.

636
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:33,200
Does he talk about his father?

637
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:35,680
No. He didn't know him.

638
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,980
Did he go to school?

639
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:43,650
He knows how to write. He
answers lots of letters.

640
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:46,790
Hmm. Is it girls who write to him?

641
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:49,660
Everyone writes to him.

642
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:51,760
Is there a girl he
loves in his village?

643
01:21:51,830 --> 01:21:55,740
Not in his village,
here. Does she love him?

644
01:21:55,810 --> 01:21:58,740
Yes, because he's handsome.

645
01:21:58,810 --> 01:22:01,870
Because he's brave and
she's very beautiful.

646
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:04,310
I know her well. She's
from my neighbour hood.

647
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:07,370
She went to the university.
They're handsome together.

648
01:22:07,450 --> 01:22:09,510
Later, the two of
them will get married.

649
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:17,530
At least, I think so.

650
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:22,690
And you, Sacha,

651
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:24,700
why are you helping the Germans?

652
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:32,140
Because they're stronger. Because
they're going to win the war.

653
01:22:32,210 --> 01:22:35,470
And because you like chocolate, huh?

654
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,070
All these people here
know they're gonna die.

655
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:58,470
So each night when they make it back,

656
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,230
it's a bonus.

657
01:23:01,310 --> 01:23:03,900
Excuse me.

658
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,410
So, every cup of tea,

659
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,710
every cigarette...

660
01:23:08,780 --> 01:23:12,310
becomes a little celebration.

661
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:14,850
Because for a lot of us,
it maybe our last night.

662
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:20,220
It's just something
you have to accept here.

663
01:23:20,290 --> 01:23:22,230
Everyone has their time.

664
01:23:26,570 --> 01:23:31,270
In the forest, the wolf
lives for three years,

665
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,270
the donkey for nine.

666
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:40,000
So, that's-that's got to
be a proverb from the Urals.

667
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,050
It makes no sense to me whatsoever.

668
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:46,020
The donkey lives longer
because he's more useful.

669
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:48,020
Makes absolute sense.

670
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:50,180
There aren't any
donkeys in the forest.

671
01:23:50,260 --> 01:23:53,190
You made it up.

672
01:23:53,260 --> 01:23:57,130
So... I'm a donkey?

673
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,100
People like you and Danilov...

674
01:24:04,170 --> 01:24:06,110
have to survive this.

675
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:09,540
People who have read
books, had an education.

676
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,550
We'll need you when the war is over.

677
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:16,310
And if you survive?

678
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:20,110
What will the useless
Vassili Zaitsev do then?

679
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:23,420
I wanna work in a factory.

680
01:24:23,490 --> 01:24:28,050
My granddad took me
to a factory once.

681
01:24:28,130 --> 01:24:33,090
There was this man
there, high up on a-

682
01:24:33,170 --> 01:24:35,570
on a foot walk.

683
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:38,800
He wasn't wearing
blue like the others.

684
01:24:38,870 --> 01:24:43,110
The people he was supervising didn't
understand what they were doing.

685
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,440
But for him, for him up there,

686
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:48,170
it was simple; it was clear.

687
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:53,450
And I thought, "One day,
I could be that man."

688
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,860
Sad to have a dream
you know won't happen.

689
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,530
Why shouldn't it?

690
01:25:08,840 --> 01:25:10,770
You'll outlive us all.

691
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,900
Hmm.

692
01:25:12,980 --> 01:25:15,950
You'll be the oldest
donkey in the forest.

693
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,760
"150 meters stand between
the Germans and the Volga.

694
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:38,230
"Today the whole world is
watching these 150meters.

695
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,360
They are what makes Stalingrad..."

696
01:25:41,440 --> 01:25:43,370
the capitol...

697
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,670
of the war.

698
01:25:50,310 --> 01:25:52,250
Your friend, Tania...

699
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:55,580
have you see her?

700
01:25:55,650 --> 01:25:58,420
She stays over there
now, with the snipers.

701
01:26:00,830 --> 01:26:03,590
Tell the major we're sending
in all of our sharpshooters...

702
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:06,320
to support the attack on the factory.

703
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,070
Tell him Vassili will be there.

704
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:02,460
I need to talk to you. Sure.

705
01:30:02,495 --> 01:30:03,780
I need to talk to you. Sure.

706
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:10,320
Danilov. Hmm?

707
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,590
You have to stop writing about me.

708
01:30:28,970 --> 01:30:31,570
I'm not gonna get him
because I'm not good enough.

709
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:35,540
Sooner or later, he's gonna
find me, he's gonna kill me.

710
01:30:35,610 --> 01:30:37,910
I've warned you before
not to talk like this.

711
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:43,280
This time it's different.

712
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,220
You've built me up...

713
01:30:47,290 --> 01:30:50,780
and up into someone I'm not.

714
01:30:52,200 --> 01:30:55,430
I can't carry that weight
anymore. I wanna fight.

715
01:30:56,600 --> 01:31:00,370
I want to fight just
as a regular soldier.

716
01:31:01,510 --> 01:31:03,440
I understand.

717
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:07,200
The thing is, you're not a regular
soldier. You're extraordinary.

718
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:10,910
No, I'm what you've made me.

719
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:13,510
Nothing more.

720
01:31:17,790 --> 01:31:20,450
Why are you telling me this now?

721
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,860
Hmm? What's happened?

722
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,330
What's changed?

723
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:35,360
Did you speak to Tania for me?

724
01:31:37,780 --> 01:31:39,710
Yes. Well...

725
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:42,180
will she reconsider?

726
01:31:45,850 --> 01:31:48,050
I don't know.

727
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,420
She should. She'll be much
safer. She should, you know that.

728
01:31:54,490 --> 01:31:58,090
Yeah. It'll be easier
to get her reassigned.

729
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:01,360
The Germans are preparing another
offensive in the city center.

730
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:04,700
The propaganda battle is crucial for
morale. We need you more than ever.

731
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:06,760
Sacha. Hold on. Sacha!

732
01:32:11,410 --> 01:32:14,350
Tell him what you know,
Sacha. Hello, Sacha.

733
01:32:14,410 --> 01:32:16,540
There was dust on the major's boots.

734
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:21,050
Sacha has the major convinced
he's gone over to the other side.

735
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:24,110
I don't need to tell you
the risk she's taking.

736
01:32:24,190 --> 01:32:27,560
The dust was yellow. There's only one
place where there's dust like that-

737
01:32:27,630 --> 01:32:30,890
in the back of the chemical
factory, a big heap on the tracks.

738
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:34,800
Well done.

739
01:32:34,870 --> 01:32:37,700
Sacha...

740
01:32:37,770 --> 01:32:40,210
wait for me outside then.

741
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:48,810
Danilov, Hmm?

742
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,790
You had no right to use him.

743
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:56,020
No, no, I didn't use him, Vassili.

744
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:59,180
He did it of his own accord.

745
01:32:59,260 --> 01:33:01,750
You know why?

746
01:33:01,830 --> 01:33:03,920
Because he believes in you!

747
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,700
Tomorrow morning, we're going to
take back the chemical factory.

748
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:18,010
Sacha's informed the
major you'll be there,

749
01:33:18,080 --> 01:33:20,780
so now you know where
you have to wait for him.

750
01:33:20,850 --> 01:33:24,050
In the middle of an assault.
I'm following orders.

751
01:33:24,120 --> 01:33:26,280
I suggest you do the same.

752
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:31,080
Now, I'm aware of the risks.

753
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,090
You'll be fine.

754
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:39,600
Comrade.

755
01:34:06,060 --> 01:34:08,000
That's the Germans up there.

756
01:34:08,060 --> 01:34:10,030
And yesterday was the Russians.

757
01:34:10,100 --> 01:34:12,190
We're not very far now.

758
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:16,970
Sacha...

759
01:34:17,040 --> 01:34:19,340
you're playing a very dangerous game.

760
01:34:20,910 --> 01:34:23,000
I want you to win.

761
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:27,410
See there? Keep
going along the river.

762
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:30,110
It's safe... for a while.

763
01:38:45,220 --> 01:38:48,150
Aah!

764
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:12,970
He's dead. We found
this on his corpse.

765
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:19,510
Your reason for being
here has ceased to exist.

766
01:39:19,590 --> 01:39:21,710
Pardon me, Herr General,

767
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:24,620
but I do not believe-

768
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:26,990
There is a plane bound for
Berlin tomorrow evening.

769
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,360
You will be on it.

770
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:35,700
Until then, I must ask
you for your dog tags.

771
01:39:37,970 --> 01:39:41,070
Imagine how Russian propaganda
would profit from your death.

772
01:39:41,140 --> 01:39:43,540
If you fall, you will fall unknown.

773
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:45,980
You've already had a near miss.

774
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:58,120
Also please take
this War Merit Cross.

775
01:39:58,190 --> 01:39:59,680
It was awarded posthumously...

776
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:02,090
to a lieutenant of the
116th Infantry Division...

777
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:03,920
who fell here during the
first days of the battle.

778
01:40:03,955 --> 01:40:05,670
Who fell here during the
first days of the battle.

779
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:08,810
He was my son.

780
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:14,380
If the landing is
captured, everything's lost!

781
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:18,820
Come here.

782
01:40:22,090 --> 01:40:24,020
What did I tell you?

783
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:26,720
You've been playing
your fiddle too much!

784
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,560
If it's confirmed that
he's dead, we're sunk!

785
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:33,360
Well, you'll sunk. It isn't true.

786
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,270
It was intercepted from
their staff headquarters.

787
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:39,210
What do they have to do, dangle
his body in front of our men?

788
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:42,270
They're lying.

789
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:46,480
That's good. Very good.

790
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:50,350
Write it, then. "Vassili
Zaitsev is not dead.

791
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:52,850
"This is what he had for
breakfast this morning.

792
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:57,360
This is a picture of him reading
today's newspaper."You're the poet".

793
01:40:57,430 --> 01:40:59,360
What?

794
01:40:59,430 --> 01:41:01,990
You won't give up the riverbank!

795
01:41:02,070 --> 01:41:05,060
I don't care if you'll
lost half your men!

796
01:41:05,140 --> 01:41:08,230
Lose the other half,
or lose yourself!

797
01:41:14,180 --> 01:41:16,580
Is he back?

798
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,650
He should be back soon.

799
01:41:22,990 --> 01:41:25,390
The German attack cut the
lines. That's why he's late.

800
01:41:28,060 --> 01:41:29,990
Can we go outside?

801
01:41:36,370 --> 01:41:38,890
I wrote to my mother about you.

802
01:41:38,970 --> 01:41:41,400
She wanted me to tell you
that once this war was over,

803
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:43,840
if there's anything you needed
- anything at all...

804
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:46,210
...our family will be there for you.

805
01:41:48,650 --> 01:41:50,740
You know I'm here for you.

806
01:41:55,150 --> 01:41:57,950
They're saying Vassili is dead.

807
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:02,360
Vassili Zaitsev will never
see his loved ones again.

808
01:42:02,430 --> 01:42:06,020
Surrender! This is your only hope.

809
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,460
You're upset.

810
01:42:12,540 --> 01:42:14,800
Because Zaitsev is dead?

811
01:42:17,740 --> 01:42:20,540
You don't have to hide
it. There's no shame in it.

812
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:23,980
You're a Russian like he is.

813
01:42:26,820 --> 01:42:28,980
Don't listen to them.

814
01:42:29,050 --> 01:42:32,320
It's just propaganda.

815
01:42:32,410 --> 01:42:34,450
He isn't dead.

816
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,530
And do you know why?

817
01:42:38,770 --> 01:42:40,960
Because I haven't killed him yet.

818
01:42:47,970 --> 01:42:49,910
I'm going to tell
you a little secret.

819
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:54,840
Only you, because I
know I can trust you.

820
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:58,080
But you must swear to me that
you won't tell another soul.

821
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:03,560
You swear?

822
01:43:03,620 --> 01:43:06,680
I found a terrific spot.

823
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,520
It's by the exit from
the train station.

824
01:43:09,600 --> 01:43:12,430
I'll hide in the water tower.

825
01:43:12,500 --> 01:43:15,490
Tomorrow. I'll wait for him there.

826
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:19,600
You'll see. He'll be there.

827
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:24,870
He always is.

828
01:43:32,020 --> 01:43:35,850
I also want you to swear that from now
on, you'll stay home where you belong.

829
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:41,860
Do you swear? Yes?

830
01:43:44,930 --> 01:43:47,870
Good.

831
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:49,930
"We know he's alive. We
know he won't fail us.

832
01:43:50,010 --> 01:43:53,300
We know because he is a part
of us now. Vassili is eternal."

833
01:43:56,380 --> 01:43:59,820
Where have you been? We've
looked everywhere for you.

834
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:03,550
Oh, didn't you hear? I was dead.

835
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:07,610
At least the noble sniper Zaitsev...

836
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:12,560
Vassili was dead.

837
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:14,560
The real one.

838
01:44:16,970 --> 01:44:19,760
Me...

839
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:21,770
I was asleep,

840
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:23,770
and I missed my chance.

841
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:29,180
Then, I was curled up
in a corner, hiding...

842
01:44:29,250 --> 01:44:31,740
from a man who wants to kill me.

843
01:44:31,820 --> 01:44:34,610
I'll talk to Kruschev.

844
01:44:34,690 --> 01:44:37,750
He'll send you back
to your old division.

845
01:44:37,820 --> 01:44:41,150
Where's Tania? She's at the shelter.

846
01:44:41,220 --> 01:44:43,490
I've been to the shelter.

847
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:45,690
I told her you weren't dead.

848
01:44:47,460 --> 01:44:50,990
The major said so. He said
the other Germans were lying.

849
01:44:51,070 --> 01:44:54,160
He told me you were waiting
for him at the station.

850
01:44:58,080 --> 01:45:00,010
Vassili.

851
01:45:20,470 --> 01:45:22,400
Vassili.

852
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:25,870
Vassili.

853
01:45:32,650 --> 01:45:34,980
My little Sacha.

854
01:45:35,050 --> 01:45:36,980
I knew it.

855
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,700
Vassili. Tania.

856
01:46:04,510 --> 01:46:06,780
I knew you weren't dead.

857
01:46:06,850 --> 01:46:09,280
How?

858
01:46:09,350 --> 01:46:12,110
Because we only just met.

859
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:21,060
I prayed for the first time
since I was a little girl.

860
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:24,430
When I opened my eyes,
Sacha was standing there...

861
01:46:24,500 --> 01:46:26,690
waiting to give me the good news.

862
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:32,640
I think he loves you
even more than I do.

863
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:59,730
To the proper military authority,

864
01:46:59,800 --> 01:47:02,360
I'm calling to the commandant's
attention the recent changes noticed...

865
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:06,500
in the attitude towards fighting
of soldier Vassili Zaitsev.

866
01:47:06,580 --> 01:47:10,670
He has attempted on several
occasions to escape his duties,

867
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:13,150
voiced doubts on the
chances of our victory...

868
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:15,150
and made defeatist
comments in public.

869
01:47:16,720 --> 01:47:19,350
The inexplicable
duration of his duel...

870
01:47:19,420 --> 01:47:24,330
with the Nazi sharpshooter
can only be explained by...

871
01:47:24,390 --> 01:47:27,190
his lack of belief in
the communist ideal.

872
01:47:35,140 --> 01:47:37,070
Good morning, Sacha.

873
01:47:39,040 --> 01:47:42,940
Once again, he knew
exactly where to find me.

874
01:47:43,010 --> 01:47:46,470
Don't you think that's strange?

875
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:50,350
Apart from me, only you knew.

876
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:53,190
I don't hold it against you, Sacha.

877
01:47:53,260 --> 01:47:56,630
You've done a very brave thing.

878
01:47:56,690 --> 01:47:59,660
You've chosen your
camp. I respect that.

879
01:47:59,730 --> 01:48:01,670
But it isn't my camp.

880
01:48:01,730 --> 01:48:04,630
We're both soldiers,

881
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:09,440
and we're both enemies,
so I know you understand.

882
01:48:09,510 --> 01:48:15,100
I'm annoyed with you, for not
staying home as I made you swear to.

883
01:48:15,180 --> 01:48:18,550
I'm annoyed with you for obliging me
to do what I'm going to have to do.

884
01:48:24,090 --> 01:48:28,030
I've never seen anyone
frown so much in their sleep.

885
01:48:31,100 --> 01:48:33,590
How long have you been watching me?

886
01:48:33,670 --> 01:48:36,070
All night.

887
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:39,100
You've been snoring
away happily for hours.

888
01:48:39,170 --> 01:48:42,110
I don't snore. Do I?

889
01:48:42,170 --> 01:48:44,110
Like a pig.

890
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:46,700
I suppose I talk in my sleep as well.

891
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:48,710
Yes.

892
01:48:50,920 --> 01:48:52,980
There's something I should tell you.

893
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:03,390
On the train...

894
01:49:03,460 --> 01:49:05,400
coming here...

895
01:49:07,270 --> 01:49:09,360
we were in the same car.

896
01:49:09,440 --> 01:49:11,370
No.

897
01:49:11,440 --> 01:49:13,630
I saw you.

898
01:49:13,710 --> 01:49:17,160
You were reading,
and you fell asleep.

899
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:23,210
I didn't dare look at
you, you were so beautiful.

900
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:26,890
It was scary.

901
01:49:29,690 --> 01:49:33,820
Afterwards, I couldn't
stop thinking about you.

902
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:35,830
It made me smile.

903
01:49:37,370 --> 01:49:41,730
And then I thought of all the
men who would get to hold you...

904
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:46,100
who'd make you laugh...

905
01:49:48,640 --> 01:49:50,580
how lucky they were.

906
01:49:53,980 --> 01:49:55,560
And now I'm the one
lying next to you.

907
01:49:55,595 --> 01:49:57,140
And now I'm the one
lying next to you.

908
01:49:59,750 --> 01:50:02,710
Was I snoring? Like a pig.

909
01:50:34,080 --> 01:50:36,810
What?

910
01:50:40,490 --> 01:50:43,680
Oh, my God! Oh, no.

911
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,690
Oh, my God! Tania, no.

912
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,750
Tania, no! No, get off me!

913
01:50:47,830 --> 01:50:50,490
Get off me! Get off
me! It's what he wants!

914
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,500
This is what he wants! Get off me!

915
01:50:52,570 --> 01:50:55,900
No, he'll kill you.
He'll kill you! Let me go!

916
01:50:55,970 --> 01:50:59,080
I'll run after you, and
he'll kill me. Let me go!

917
01:50:59,210 --> 01:51:01,970
Let me go! This is what
he wants! I'll get him.

918
01:51:02,040 --> 01:51:04,910
I promise I'll get him.

919
01:51:04,980 --> 01:51:08,040
I'll get his rifle for
you. I promise, Tania.

920
01:51:27,240 --> 01:51:30,570
I need you.

921
01:51:33,780 --> 01:51:36,840
You have to leave now, Mrs.
Filipov. Stalingrad may fall.

922
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:39,640
The last of the boats are leaving.
The Germans will be here any moment.

923
01:51:39,710 --> 01:51:43,080
He's brought you a pass. You'll
be safe on the other side.

924
01:51:43,150 --> 01:51:45,920
Gather your things, and we'll help
you carry them to the landing stage.

925
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:49,580
I'm not leaving. This is my home.

926
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:52,650
This is my Sacha's
home. I can't leave.

927
01:51:52,730 --> 01:51:55,060
I have to tell you
something, Mrs. Filipov.

928
01:51:57,630 --> 01:52:00,620
Something very
difficult to understand.

929
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:02,640
It's about Sacha.

930
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:19,820
He's gone over to the Germans.
He's betrayed his country.

931
01:52:19,890 --> 01:52:22,290
He's with the enemy now.
He won't be coming back.

932
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:27,100
Oh, my God.

933
01:52:30,070 --> 01:52:32,000
Oh, my God.

934
01:52:34,910 --> 01:52:38,140
He's become a traitor.

935
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:41,080
The poor little thing.

936
01:52:41,150 --> 01:52:44,010
What has he done?

937
01:52:46,750 --> 01:52:48,780
So, he's going to stay over there?

938
01:52:54,330 --> 01:52:59,160
Yes... he's going to stay over there.

939
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:02,930
I shouldn't be saying
this, comrade Commissar,

940
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,870
but maybe it's for the best.

941
01:53:05,940 --> 01:53:08,300
If the Germans have
won, he'll be safe.

942
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:12,280
I know it's wrong, but perhaps
he has made the right choice.

943
01:53:31,560 --> 01:53:34,430
Oh! Oh, Tania! Tania?

944
01:53:35,600 --> 01:53:38,370
Oh, Tania! Tania!

945
01:53:39,440 --> 01:53:42,410
Oh, my God! Oh!

946
01:53:58,660 --> 01:54:03,360
I need a doctor! A doctor!

947
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:09,930
I have a pass. I have a pass!

948
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,940
You must let her cross.

949
01:54:14,640 --> 01:54:16,580
Please!

950
01:54:16,640 --> 01:54:20,710
It's useless. She'll never
make it. No! No, she will!

951
01:54:20,780 --> 01:54:23,880
She's my daughter! She's my daughter!

952
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:26,390
I beg of you! All right.

953
01:54:26,450 --> 01:54:29,290
Oh, thank you! Put
this one on the boat.

954
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:18,800
Where is he?

955
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:21,400
Where's the major?

956
01:55:21,480 --> 01:55:23,670
A few inches from your face.

957
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:29,480
I've been such a fool, Vassili.

958
01:55:29,550 --> 01:55:33,790
Man will always be man.

959
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:35,950
There is no new man.

960
01:55:37,260 --> 01:55:40,630
We tried so hard to create
a society that was equal,

961
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:43,460
where there'd be nothing
to envy your neighbor.

962
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:46,900
But there's always something to envy.

963
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:50,630
A smile...

964
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:52,640
a friendship.

965
01:55:54,150 --> 01:55:58,170
Something you don't have
and want to appropriate.

966
01:55:58,250 --> 01:56:01,840
In this world-
even a Soviet one-

967
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:05,080
there will always be rich and poor.

968
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:08,950
Rich in gifts...

969
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:12,360
poor in gifts.

970
01:56:13,430 --> 01:56:15,370
Rich in love...

971
01:56:16,570 --> 01:56:18,500
poor in love.

972
01:56:24,810 --> 01:56:27,870
Tania isn't coming back.

973
01:56:27,950 --> 01:56:30,920
She's dead, Vassili.

974
01:56:39,590 --> 01:56:43,860
She was cut down by
shrapnel. It was quick.

975
01:56:43,930 --> 01:56:45,920
I don't think she even saw it coming.

976
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:49,730
She was on her way back to you.

977
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:54,900
As soon as she had seen Mrs. Filipov to
the boats, she was coming back for you.

978
01:56:54,980 --> 01:56:59,810
She was right. You're
a good man, Vassili.

979
01:57:03,950 --> 01:57:06,510
I want to help you, Vassili.

980
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:09,250
Let me do one last thing.

981
01:57:09,320 --> 01:57:11,810
Something useful for a change.

982
01:57:17,400 --> 01:57:19,370
Let me show you where the major is.

983
01:57:19,430 --> 01:57:21,900
Don't do that. Don't do that!

984
02:01:36,570 --> 02:01:41,770
Today, February3, 1943, is
an ominous day for Hitler...

985
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:46,230
and the endless columns of hundreds
of thousands of German prisoners.

986
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:50,200
It is an unforgettable day
of hope for our motherland.

987
02:02:03,080 --> 02:02:07,110
After 180 days of heroic combat...

988
02:02:07,190 --> 02:02:09,240
in the market city of Stalingrad,

989
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:14,560
and as a result of the valor and
self-sacrifice of our soldiers,

990
02:02:14,630 --> 02:02:17,760
the commander of our
glorious Red Army...

991
02:02:17,830 --> 02:02:20,990
received the
unconditional surrender...

992
02:02:21,070 --> 02:02:24,800
of the German fascist invaders.

993
02:02:36,950 --> 02:02:41,180
Sorry. No, young
man, I cannot find...

994
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:43,190
a matching name in the
book. Could you check again?

995
02:02:43,260 --> 02:02:46,090
This is the address and
her name. She is not here.

996
02:02:46,160 --> 02:02:50,760
Yes, this is our address,
but we don't have her anymore.

997
02:02:50,830 --> 02:02:53,600
This is the address. She's
been here. I'm so sorry.

998
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:56,400
She wrote to me. I looked
three times. She's not here.

999
02:02:56,470 --> 02:03:01,930
Believe me, there is no Tania
Chernova. I can't help you.

1000
02:03:02,010 --> 02:03:03,940
I'm so sorry.

1001
02:03:06,940 --> 02:03:10,940
